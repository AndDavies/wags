Some reviewers noted that the experience can depend on the individual agent, but most were able to successfully travel with their pets in the cabin. A few customers had issues with agents being overly strict about size or height requirements, but overall the airline seems open to allowing pets on flights as long as guidelines are followed.

She is tiny, but her long legs don't allow her to stand up without touching the top of the carrier, so I was nervous. When I flew from Montreal, the agent looked at my dog that I was carrying in my arms. He didn't ask to see the carrier or anyhting. He filled up the checklist let us through. When I flew from NY LGA, my dog was already in the carrier and the agent just asked me to open and took a look at the dog. She said it was fine, filled the checklist and let us through. No one measured or weighed anything. We will soon fly from Knoxville soon, but I am obviously less nervous than I was after these two positive experiences. I am using a Mr Peanuts carrier that measures 11\"x11\"\u00d717 3/4. It fit perfectly under the seat. We put it horizontally and even opened the extension to give Nevy more space during the flight. - [![Karina](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/HXCZjAzyZc/KarinaWyczynski.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\ \\\\ Karina\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ Jul. 29, 2024](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1960303) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg) American Airlines Phoenix I was a nervous wreck after reading the reviews. I have a 21 pound mini poodle. I weighed him at home in his soft crate and he was around 23 pounds + he has longish legs. He fits comfortably in a 19x13x9 soft crate (brand: PidiPiti off Amazon). I set him down on the scale and it showed 24.5 pounds so I was still a nervous wreck about it. Meanwhile, the agent asked me what kind of animal it is and if she could see him. I popped his head out of the top of the carrier and she said \u201coh you are a little bigger.\u201d Proceeded to hand me paperwork to sign regarding the dog, I paid the pet fee, and we were on our way. I have friends that travel with their dogs and they also mentioned not having any issues and people are more likely to leave reviews when they have a bad experience rather than good. Unless I got lucky, it really was a smooth experience. I paid extra to have a \u201cmain cabin extra\u201d seat and I think it definitely helped the situation too. There was extra leg room and he fit great under the seat. Flight attendants were great. Truly, no complaints. I hope it continues to be like this because he is such an easy traveler! - [![Leka](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/6o8e67VuWa/LekaRomao.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\ \\\\ Leka\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1705493) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg) Best Experience in cabin with my pup We were worried about flying across the country (San Diego to Pittsburgh) with my 17lbs (20.6lbs with the Sherpa carrier) poddle mix. The experience was so flawless that I couldn\u2019t not write this review. Will drop a few tips below as well. When we first arrived at the SD airport checkin, my dog was sitting down with the Sherpa top zipper open. The lady was questioning that she was looking a bit too big for the carrier, and politely asked me to see her fully inside. I dropped a treat in her bag, and zipped up the top completely. She smiled and asked me to weigh my pup, 20lbs no problem. On the way back (PIT airport) I already walked into checkin with her fully inside/zipped, and the lady didn\u2019t even ask for anything nor asked to weigh her OR sign anything. So pro tip: bring your pet already inside the carrier when you walk into checkin to avoid questions. Same goes for boarding the plane (we had stops in Chicago on the way in and in DFW on the way back). For all 4 flights we boarded the plane with my bb already in the carrier/zipped, and some flight attendants even asked \u201cpuppy!! what kind is it??\u201d and overall got super excited to have a pup in the flight. During takeoff, I kept her under the seat in front of me, but she was never fully zipped in, and appreciated being able to keep and eye on us, and getting some pets. Once we were up in the air, for most of the flight we took her out of the carrier and she slept alll the way (she doesn\u2019t need meds and is very calm when traveling) in between our seats. I\u2019m sure flight attendants saw it, and never asked or bothered us at all, since she was extremely calm and just napping between our seats. This was her second time on a plane. First was Southwest to New Orleans last May, and it was also a great experience, except that multiple times we got asked to put her fully zipped up inside the bag. With this not having happened a single time with us in any of the 4 airports or planes, I need to say this was a flawless experience, and it made American my first choice when bringing my pup. I wish they would do South America flights with pups in cabin again, will definitely choose them again. Quick info: pup is a 2.5yo, 17lbs poodle mix. Didn\u2019t use any sedatives or medicine at all, just a lot of treats, toys and blankets to keep her cozy. We upgraded our seats for more leg room, def recommend if you\u2019re able to. - [![Megan](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/0Hi31R2H2L/MeganEaton.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\ \\\\ Megan\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1664775) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg) Easy first trip with my cat After reading reviews on this website was convinced I was going to get turned away. I took my cat on his first trip Bradley to Charlotte. I had the best time ever at check in and the dog getting checking in front of me had the wrong carrier and they were allowed to buy a new one and just go through TSA. Both customer service people at both airports were super nice. The Charlotte one signed my pet agreement for me. Honestly I think it\u2019s more trouble for them to turn your pet away than to just let you be happy. I wasn\u2019t even asked if he was on medication. I opted for light meds for fear and stress. I went with priority boarding in group 5 and had the extra leg room seat going. It was perfect. Next time I\u2019d try to book extra leg room on both flights. Regular seats are kinda tight. My carrier was slightly longer, I had no drama as long as he met the 20lbs requirement. Over all it was the best experience for my cat\u2019s first flight. - [![Tara](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\ \\\\ Tara\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1660646) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg) Seamless!!

I have always avoided flying American when I need to travel with my dog due to the horror stories I've seen here. On a recent trip from PDX to DFW, I had no choice but to book myself and my dog on American. I was worried but had a little hope given the recent reviews here saying the policy has changed (though I still had a backup plan in case they turned my dog away), and my experience was totally seamless! My 14-pound Pekingese mix had absolutely no trouble in PDX or DFW. They didn't question the size of the carrier, make him turn around, or check whether he could fully stand up in his bag. I took off one bone as they did weigh him inside the carrier to make sure he was under the 21-pound limit-- we came out to 18 pounds (no other airline has made me do this, and my dog, despite being pretty tiny, was a little close to the limit-- so it is a bit more exclusive than other airlines). After weighing and signing the form saying that the carrier was regulation size and I wouldn't let him out while in-flight, we were totally good to go. I recommend ordering a bag scale so you can weigh your dog/carrier before flying to give yourself peace of mind and avoid surprises, but if you're good there, you should be good to go! - [![Eth](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/Y4hNY56Wl1/Eth.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\ \\\\ Eth\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1573684) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) Just don't... I know there are some outliers here that have had good experiences, but GENERALLY, you'll have a bad experience with AA and your pet. It largely depends on who the person at the counter is. My lady started the paperwork after weighing my dog until some old lady came and whispered in her ear to check my bag size. The AA website tells you a RECOMMENDED size, it doesn't say under or over the recommended size. I figured that since it was only 2 inches taller, it wouldn't be an issue. After all, does anyone actually slide their carry on bags completely under the chair? Anyway, after the initial lady helping me at the front desk was forced (or it seemed like it by the old lady) to measure my bag, she told me I was over by 2. I showed her how it says this is a recommended size online and what her paper says, differ. While waiting for the supervisor, I began asking a few questions to the old lady. She wanted nothing to do with me, and would not look or speak to me. I was still respectful at this point. Then the supervisor came over and bluntly told me it was too large. I then showed her what it says online and she told me to use common sense. At first she told me the bag was too large. When I proved her wrong, she told me my dog was too large. My dog is under the 20lb limit. He has long legs, but he still fits comfortable in the bag and can spin around and lay down. I prefer if she just told me that my bag was too large lol. After the common sense comment, she told me to \"look at my dog, he's not OK.\" I treat my dog like an absolute king that he is, do not tell me otherwise lady. I was furious at this point and simply left after telling them to F off with my middle finger. They said \"Right back at ya!\" - lol. Back to my initial point, it depends who is at the front desk. It's safer to travel with another airline because AA just likes to toss the dice & gable with ya. It's a shame because I used to swear by AA, even when other dog owners told me that SW & Delta are better. I stuck to AA regardless & this is where it got me. Y'all lot a loyal customer. - [![Skip](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/HbXA7in2vN/SkipBaker.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\ \\\\ Skip\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1548222) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg) Great Experience I followed all of the rules and had no trouble whatsoever.

I was very stressed after reading all of these reviews saying that AA enforced their \"stand up and turn around policy\" only to find out that they have recently removed this from their policy because so many people complained! My pup is 6 months old and has very long legs for a chihuahua mix so I was anticipating push back on her AA sized approved carrier. They didn't even measure my carrier and just weighed her in it which was 18 lbs. The customer service rep was thrilled to tell me that the policy changed because it became such a hassle! I hope this relieves anyone from choosing AA because if there was going to be a problem I was definitely going to stop using them. My only qualm is that even though the carrier was approved, the space under the seat was very tight and didn't allow for the carrier to go all the way under. Might be smart to upgrade if you can to have more room for you and your pup! - [![Gabby](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/QeiyMnke3K/GabbySmith.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\ \\\\ Gabby\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1508366) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg) No issues traveling with pet I normally do not leave reviews, but felt the need to post my experiences flying with American with my 8 week old pet. I never flew with American, so I was nervous from the beginning. I flew from Houston to Miami (and back to Houston). I did not have any issues with the process of flying with my pet. Customer service at the airport was very helpful. They did not ask my dog to move around like, stand, sit etc. like I read in some reviews. The customer services rep jsut looked to make sure my puppy was in the carrier and he fit in the carrier. I paid my pet fee and was off to my gate. Now, the customer service reps at the gate looked like they hated their jobs and did not want to work yet alone help out a passanger. One of the workers looked annoyed when myself or another passanger asked her a question. However, the manager on duty was very helpful and happy to help anyone. The carrier I purchased was the correct dimentions that is on American's website. The carrier I had was a little snug under the seat, and it did not fit completely under the seat. If you can, I suggest spending a little extra money to get a seat with extra leg room. I was upgraded to the main cabin on the way to Miami and I feel like the main cabin would have been better with my pet. Besides the unhappy aggent at the gate, my experience was good. - [![Marie](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\ \\\\ Marie\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1299673) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg) Excellent Experience After reading the reviews we were scared about flying with our French Bulldog puppy to visit family over this Memorial Day weekend.

Alaska has been great. Southwest was great, but American seems to just not want any in cabin pets. Despite having flown the same route before, we were held up by a gate agent in BUR in CA. She said our dogs were suddenly too big for their carriers. They're on the larger side for an in cabin pet, but can very comfortably fit in their airline approved carriers and turn around. They're perfectly well behaved, but it was clear from the moment she walked into the room huffing that she was interested in ruining someone's day. Having worked for many years in customer service, I calmly and kindly tried working with her. Even going so far to fill out the service animal paperwork since all of their training and medical documents are in order. However, this woman made us take the dogs out of their carriers to \"measure them\" and another dog lunged at them. One of them yipped (playfully), but that was all. Then she said a service dog would never bark (not true, but whatever) and that now she could not allow our dogs to be service animals at American. I promptly walked over to Alaska and Southwest to try and find a new similar flight and both were accommodating and assured me that of course my dogs fit in their carriers. Having worked and planned so extensively with their trainer and vet, I was deeply insulted by this gate agents behavior. Long story short, STAY AWAY. We ended up paying more than double to fly out last minute with another airline. - [![Allie](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\ \\\\ Allie\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1186998) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) AA obviously does not want dogs to fly in the cabin The counter agent in Columbus, Ohio was rude and condescending from the moment we stepped to the counter. We have flown with our 14 pound (13.5 year old) Shih Tzu multiple times on other airlines with no issue. The agent claimed our dog wasn\u2019t safe and didn\u2019t fit the carrier after he demanded that she turn around and she would not. He stated he would not allow her to fly and we could speak with the manager. I\u2019m not even sure why we waited to speak with the manager because it was obvious after he was whispering with the agent that he was not going to reconsider. He claimed it was a TSA requirement that he could see her turn in her carrier and by the time he was talking with us, she was now laying in her carrier and since she wouldn\u2019t get up and turn around (again it was clear he had no intention of considering allowing her), he denied us boarding. Since we knew she has flown with no issues at Southwest, we went down to the counter and showed them her in her carrier (laying down asleep at this point) and asked if they had a flight available and if there were any issues with her fit in the carrier. The agents said she was completely fine and could tell there was no issue with her fitting appropriately in the carrier. They were appalled when we shared how we were treated by AA. They shared that there is nothing that forces an owner to prove a dog can stand up and turn around (she can - she didn\u2019t want to) and that it was clear to them that her size was no issue. We were grateful for their kindness and they were more than happy to book us on an alternate flight with them. We will never consider flying AA again. Truly, AA - if you don\u2019t want pets in cabin, just make that a policy. Do not instead put people through that as they have gone through all the motions for preparing for a flight. Beyond that, if you counter agent does not want to work with customers and has a rude and condescending personality, don\u2019t assign them to be curstomer-facing! - [![Chaya](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\ \\\\ Chaya\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1328982) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) Need help I bought a ticket on KLM (operated by American and Delta) and have now been told I can\u2019t bring my dog with me.

The check in person just asked to see my dog in the carrier and asked if he could turn around. Did not ask to see him turn around. I had to fill out a sheet of information. He did not weigh my dog. My dog has separation anxiety so I was worried about him under the seat but he just went right to sleep since it was midnight. I flew back to Denver from Miami airport which I was more worried about.

Never once have we had check in problems with airlines like JetBlue. Now, American Airlines, on the other hand, is flat out terrible. The check in staff at the ticket counter in Jacksonville (JAX) airport was beyond ridiculous today. They tried to reject our dog as not approved. Our small dog easily, repeatedly turned about inside our soft pet carrier that meets AA regulation size. The check in rep said the dog didn\u2019t fit in her carrier, a carrier which fits small dogs up to 20lbs. Our small Westie easily fits in the soft carrier and turned around several times in front of the rep. The rep suggested the dog couldn\u2019t use her legs. We asked how would it be possible for the dog to turnaround so fast and easily if she wasn\u2019t standing and turning. The whole exchange was absurd. We will no longer travel on AA as they\u2019ve tried to reject our small dog in an approved carrier and their reasoning didn\u2019t make sense. The AA rep was completely unreasonable and her manager begrudgingly approved the dog to fly but then the rep later suggested she was going to note our file as ban from dog travel due to the dog being too big. Huh? Weird. These front counter AA reps need far better training. We dearly love our pet and would never do anything harmful to our dog. We take excellent care of her. We\u2019d never squish her in an ill fitting travel carrier. Never. After the harassing and insulting exchange, we\u2019ve had it with AA. We were friendly and respectful in our exchange with the rep yet sadly we can\u2019t say we got the same in return. We\u2019ll take our travel money and little dog and fly other airlines as their service was idiotic and unjustifiably harassing of long time loyal customers. Super disappointed in the American Airlines reps conduct and we were highly offended at the suggestion of banning our dog. Utterly ridiculous and unjustifiable experience. - [![Amy](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/M6aM9C1MGB/AmyHutchison.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\ \\\\ Amy\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1231016) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg) Charlotte and Ft Myers airport get 5 bones I know others have said they\u2019ve had issues so I wanted to write a good review to let those of you checking it out to be cautiously optimistic. I have a 17 pound jack Russell terrier. I got a 12 inch height carrier which is slightly larger than the AA guidelines, but she still was right at the max of how comfortable I would be having her in it. (CLT airport) I had her in the carrier when I brought her to check in. I explained that I had filled her carrier with things like her leash, treats, etc\u2026 so she would be overweight but I could pull those out if necessary. She said she doesn\u2019t care about the weight. The agent then asked me to have her turn around and face the other way. She can do it, but she kind of crouches when she does so I was nervous about this. She said, \u201cshe looks good\u201d and finished. TSA was super friendly with her and even asked for pets. (RSW/Ft Myers airport) They didn\u2019t even look at her. \u201cShe\u2019s good.\u201d And waved me through. Please note this airport doesn\u2019t have any inside pet relief areas so make sure to take yours outside before security. It is very possible to fly with a pet on AA, even if they are on the larger size of the guidelines. - [![Christine](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\ \\\\ Christine\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1266426) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) Not worth trying! We have traveled with our 10 pound dog before on AA. Following all the guidelines- getting him the required carrier, having a vet checkup prior to flight, reserving his spot well in advance. The last time we traveled on AA (only a few months prior, leaving from the same exact departure airport) there were no issues. Today, they claimed he was too large to move comfortably in his carrier for for his 1.5 hour flight. They said we could acquire a larger bag and then be able to get on our flight. They suggested visiting United and Southwest to ask to purchase one of their carriers (again, despite the fact that we had the carrier that fits AA\u2019s size guidelines specifically). When visiting other ticket counter, they told us they were unable to sell (or even show us) their carriers unless we were flying with them. We went back to the AA counter to see what the next steps were and the new agent that was helping us had no hesitation to allow our dog to board the plane. Even happily charged the fee to our card! It wasn\u2019t until at the ticket printing stage did she say \u201coh somebody said the dog is actually too big\u201d. When we told them he flew previously on their airline in the same carrier the woman said \u201cdogs grow\u201d. Huh?! He\u2019s still way below the size max that are listed!! The most infuriating part was there were no next steps. No offer to help get us on a flight out the next day. Nothing. Just \u201chere are your IDs back\u201d while simultaneously fawning over how cute he. All the while he was stressing out over being forced to do circles in his carrier while propped on the luggage scale in front of an audience of 5 employees. Of course now nobody will speak to us about a refund, but they were happy to immediately cancel our first class seats to make them available on the flight. Just say you don\u2019t allow dogs!! - [![JF](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/Qoa99n91iD/3BAD1F89-0173-47F4-9FDE-D4BE1A221F0C.jpeg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\ \\\\ JF\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1263805) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) Rude and Nasty about 13 lb dog in Panama City airport FL First of all, let me say I used to fly AA weekly for work and have a high status. I will never fly this airline again or only as last resort. We have flown cross country numerous times with our petite 13 lb Cavalier King Charles Spaniel on Delta and United with no issues. On Dec 17th we went to our little airport in northern FL - Panama City Beach and the agent checked my dog\u2019s carrier and said it was fine and took our payment and just as she was just about done, another agent butted in and said she needed to check the carrier again as she thought it was too small for our dog. She made me put her in the case and zip it again and get her to stand up and turn around and then said - Nope it\u2019s too small for her. We went through 4 levels of supervisors and me totally red in face with anger before they finally approved her to fly. My poor dog was totally flipped out as they made me take her in and out of her crate so many times. They were making all these excuses that TSA would not approve and that the Pilot would report them and then lied and said she couldn\u2019t have her blanket or little stuffed animal in there. They were rude from the get go - never apologized and caused us to spend 45 minutes at the ticket counter. I will be tweeting about this and writing to AA CEO. They wouldn\u2019t give us their names either but my husband took a picture of them. At least we got to fly with her to NY in our original first class seats but we are done with American Airlines.

Most often American Airlines, but also Delta regularly and occasionally United. In my experience, Delta has never given me any trouble checking in and they are incredibly nice at Hartsfield in Atlanta. United is most likely to be picky and they have made me demonstrate that my dog can stand up and turn around in her under seat carrier, which I think is a stupid rule for in cabin pets. American is ok but often I get agents that have never checked in a pet and the process takes a long time since they have to go get someone to coach them through the process. I would pick Delta every time for an easy, no hassle check in and flight. - [![Sara](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\ \\\\ Sara\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1703153) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) Do Not Fly Delta With In Cabin Dog! On our flight we had our two dogs and the way we were treated was extremely disrespectful. It was our dogs first flight so they were a little scared and we were delayed waiting for de-icing. The dogs whined a bit and couple little barks and the flight attendants approached us right away to get them \u201cunder control\u201d. A couple minutes later the next flight attendant came and threaten to de-board us because our dogs whined a couple times. They did not ask if we needed anything. No one on the plane was complaining. It was extremely stressful for us and the dogs. I felt extremely uncomfortable and unwelcome and was very anxious for the whole flight after that. When gearing up for landing the flight attendant came by and rudely said \u201cyou know they have to go under the seat for landing.\u201d Acting as if we were dumb and knew nothing. No one else around us was told to put their bags under the seats. I felt extremely targeted and bullied once I stepped foot on the flight with my dogs. We put a complaint in with customer care and they pretty much did nothing. They offered us $50 vouchers that can only be used on another flight within the year. I will never fly with them again with our dogs. Awful airline. - [![Pablo](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/BDfBq9bExb/PabloAvils.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\ \\\\ Pablo\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1594274) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) Some unnecessary attitude from attendant. We flew our 12 lb maltipoo from LAX to Orlando, Tofu had just arrived from a long flight from China and he was quite scared about everything happening around him. He never barks or makes any sound all he needed was to stick out his little head to see us and feel safe. Most of the staff even came to say hi but this dog hating attendant started raising her voice to us that he had to be completely inside the carrier. As I tried to put him back in he was resisting and she was waiting there to see me push him in, I just said I was trying as he was resisting a bit to bend down and then she raised her voice to us and started scolding me for having opened the top zip in the first instance. In the end she made her little scene and got her dose of attention of course but quite unnecessary in my opinion. My wife and I were the only passengers seating in that row she made sure we felt as if we committed a big crime and something serious would await us after landing. Nothing happened in the end but the attitude and lack of empathy towards the dog made us conclude we\u2019ll look for other airlines in the future. - [![Courtney](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/dFzdvUKME8/CourtneyElliott.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\ \\\\ Courtney\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1460807) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) Don\u2019t go through LAX with your pet unless VERY small Recently we had a trip booked from LAX to EWR. Originally I booked on United but after seeing all the reviews we canceled our United flight and booked through Delta, choosing to instead go to JFK, even though it was out of the way, but wanted to make sure we had no issues. Most all of the reviews I read for Delta, people had no issues, but of course after switching our flight, I started hearing about how some people had issues specifically flying out of LAX on Delta, and that proved to be true. My puppy is only 13 pounds, and had a carrier that was rated up to 25 pounds. He can move around it with zero issues and has tons of space. He likes to lean on the side though and the Delta agent immediately decided he was too big. She called over her manager who did let us fly, but not without a big lecture first, which frankly was obnoxious. Our return flight on Delta, out of BTV, we had zero issues. The agent just asked us a few questions and sent us along our way. Needless to say we will never fly Delta out of LAX again and unless you have a very small dog I definitely don\u2019t recommend trying. The manager said she turns away multiple dogs a day. - [![Marta](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\ \\\\ Marta\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1417179) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) Depends on Agent Overall, Delta has been fairly travel-friendly for my 18 lb mini-goldendoodle. She was a pandemic puppy (now 3.5 years old) and has been traveling since she was 12 weeks long distances (predominantly Boston - Seattle). She's the most well-behaved, calm pup and LOVES her carrier - jumps into it by herself and her carrier fits fine on most Delta aircraft (including the smaller embraer 170/175s that go between Boston - NYC). I travel a lot for work and typically don't have problems, but have definitely run into a handful of instances where the agent thinks my dog is too big. As someone else said, it's really about the agent you get - some don't even look, others bring other people over and tell me she's too large (she's tall and fluffy, but can absolutely move around comfortably in her carrier). It's frustrating because you never know who you'll get and how the experience will be. Additionally, calling to add the pet to the reservation is a pain - I typically just use the Delta app to message an agent and copy/paste the save verbiage that they always require (size, breed, age, carrier dimensions, etc). It's also helpful to look at your aircraft in advance so you can ensure your carrier will fit depending on the plane/class you're in. - [![Sandee](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\ \\\\ Sandee\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1162407) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg) No problems I recently flew roundtrip on Delta from Boston to Kalispell, MT and I did not have any problems bringing my dog on board. The ticket agent gave me a tag for my carrier and did not ask to look at my pet. The last time I flew American, they asked to see my dog and then they didn't want to let me board the flight because they said my dog could not walk around comfortably in the carrier. I recommend Delta for traveling with pets on board, they are easy going and welcoming to pets. - [![Michelle](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/8G2PXFG5AH/edison_pump.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\ \\\\ Michelle\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1086405) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) Delta - 2022 Pet Fee DECREASED!!!

He was a big boy...I disclosed this with the reservation agent that added my frenchie to my reservation - something you need to do prior to your flight since it's first come first serve and there's a limit to the number of pets allowed per flight. At six months, my frenchie had been riding around in his carrier for three months and was very comfortable. I have a large Sherpa brand soft carrier that met the max size allowable. Cut to the chase, I get to the counter, the agent asked me to place my frenchie and carrier on the scale. She then asked me to unzip the bag...upon seeing my frenchie, she told me that he was too big although he was laying comfortably in the bag. She asked two red coats for their opinion - they also said he was too big. After more pleading the two red coats asked three more red coats...the three red coats all said YES. It was an anxiety filled experience. Their main complaint was that my frenchie couldn't stand in his carrier to which I answered, he doesn't stand in his carrier, he lays down and sleeps! Anyway, once we got through my frenchie slept through the entire flight. On the return trip, the agent didn't even ask to see my pup. All she asked for was his health certificate, which I had along with all his vaccination paperwork. Seems it really is about who you get at the counter. Would I do it again? I'm not sure...wish they had a way to prescreen prior to arriving to the airport to reduce the anxiety because once you're at the airport, what do you do if you're denied? - [![Cheryl](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\ \\\\ Cheryl\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/985900) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) Doesn\u2019t allow 2 dogs next to each other Delta doesn\u2019t allow 2 dogs to sit next to each other.

The next day when we came on time, same guy was on lunch, and another person told me this cage is not good for flying with Delta, I was shocked, because yesterday it was good and today its not good. I ask him if he can book ut for the fly, and I can go buy another cage, I just not want to be late again, he say no. I was cry and I called to customer service but nothing they can do. I have to wait when the manager ( same guy from Yesterday) will came back from his lunch to talk to him. When he came, he take the cage , he say we gonna put screw on it, but we was late for this direct fly. and the cat instead on 5 hours have to fly 11. I feel so bed for this pure kitten, but I can't came back another day again. I using the same cages all the time, its work perfect for Lufthansa, Turkish airlines, KLM, American Airlines, but it's not good for DELTA, how its possible???? Very disappointed, its so stressful day for me and I'll never work with them again and newer recommend them to anybody. - [![Caroline](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\ \\\\ Caroline\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/37676) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) MEM-ATL-BRU After reading lots of negative reviews, I thought i might share the great experience I had this weekend travelling with my bojack terrier 18lbs. I purchased the Sherpa Delta medium bag and had all the medical records ready when checking in. The agent had a quick look at the paperwork and did not even check on my dog. The aircraft from Memphis to ATL was an MD88 and from ATL to BRU 767-300 (eco comfort seat) we were even allowed to pre-board as i had my dog. Again, nobody on the plane even paid attention to my dog. The bag fitted perfectly under the seats ( window seat) and we had a great trip. My dog slept through even during the landing. I hope this will motivate some of you to travel with your pet on Delta, you always need to call them before and they will check the aircraft to see if yes or no the carrier fits. I will report my next experience to you once i fly back from BRU to MEM. - ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg) Mike More than a year ago ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg) Ridiculously expensive Wanted to take my large dog (80 lbs) across the country BOS LAX.

She's a fairly big papillon, 11 lbs and 11 inches at the shoulder, but she's got a SleepyPod Air that can shorten as needed or be extended for more comfort in the terminal. At RDU she got checked in at the counter and they loved her, and also the special services line is super quick compared to the endless bag drop lines. We went past the bomb sniffing dogs and through security no problem. The plane was half empty so other than stowing her under the seat for takeoff she was in the empty seat next to me for the whole flight. And she's a very very relaxed sort of dog, so she didn't make a peep for her entire flight. Now flying home from BOS, the check in lady was concerned she was too big for the carrier (because she's a very fluffy papillon and her fluff was everywhere) but when I told her that she was fine and the vet had approved the carrier she was okay with it. I feel like there should be some sort of way to get a vet-approved-to-fly-in-this-kennel certificate so I don't have to explain that my dog is 60% fur by volume to the lady again. Then we were in line for security and we were halfway through the line when a TSA guy looked at the bag (it looks more like a duffel bag than a dog carrier) and asked \"Is that a dog?\". Then he proceeded to drag us out of line, because apparently she couldn't go past their bomb sniffing dog, and scolded the ladies supervising the beginning of the line and told them that it was a dog and they put us in a special line that went right to the ticket scanners. So skipping the line was nice, but maybe if you're flying make sure to let everyone official know that you're carrying a dog. We've already booked our tickets for Christmas with Delta! - ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg) Al More than a year ago ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) Pet Cargo Staff We flew ourselves and our pet labrador on Delta Cargo roundtrip LAX-DTW for may years but the staff was so bad we've changed to other airlines. They're always trying to find a way to reject you for container, certificate, weather, etc. even though you are within the guidelines (and have shipped with them before.) Apparently their rule is to let the desk have wide latitude despite the written rules. They even tried to reject us on the return trip for improper water container or something when it was the thing Delta Cargo in LA had insisted on. They also used the suspicion of us being breeders as a way to delay and almost miss the plane. In Detroit, the staff went into their glass office to \"inspect the paperwork\". My kids were crying because Delta initially said they wouldn't take the dog. They were literally filing their nails, looking and laughing at us from in there. So not just slow and incompetent, as they are here in LA, but actually mean. - ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg) Brenna More than a year ago ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg) Great Experience with Delta After reading a lot of these reviews I was nervous about flying from Raleigh/Durham to Seattle with my cat on Delta, but I had a great experience from start to finish. It was easy to make my reservation for my cat by calling Delta, and they told me the exact specifications of the underseat area on the plane I was flying on. This allowed me to buy a cat carrier that I was sure would fit. I arrived at the airport an hour and a half before my flight, but happened to arrive at an extremely busy time with gigantic lines. I went straight to the special services line and they were able to check me and my cat in quickly and easily. I was dreading going through security with my skittish cat, but it all went very smoothly. The cat carrier I bought was a small Original Delux model from Sherpa, and it fit perfectly under the seat in front of me on the airplane.

I even had a pilot text me once to say that he had seen my pups loaded and they were doing great! I was super impressed that he took the time to do that. They also called me once when the pups needed to be put on a later flight and explained that they were being cared for and were doing fine.

The people on the phone at Delta Cargo were really great...accommodating and helpful. The problems came when I went to pick him up. First, his flights were delayed by two hours, then four hours. Okay, not great, but I was following his progress via Flighttracker and at least I knew about it. The real problem came when I went to pick him up at Seatte Tacoma airport. There I was told that he had \"been taken off that flight for some reason\" but they couldn't say why, and he was going to be another flight two hours later. Basically their attitude was a big shrug, snottiness, and no information. I then called the national cargo people, who couldn't tell me anything either. I was really upset because he's an older cat and was terrified that he had had a health episode or some other reason. I wasn't the only pet owner whose pets experienced the exact same thing...there were six of us in that cargo facility waiting for our pets and getting zero help or reassurance. When he did finally arrive, he was wet with with urine and very hungry and thirsty. I thought it was the best of the bad choices but if I had to do it again, I woudn't. Load More Reviews"

Pup wasn't allowed. I have read all the terrible reviews here but unfortunately by the time I did I already booked a non refundable ticket from yyz to yvr. So I decided I would try my luck. But if I were you I wouldn't especially if you're flying out of yyz. Essentially my dog is rejected. The bag fits the dimension I even brought an extra bag just in case. My dog is a 7lb shihpoo. He's absolutely tiny. But they kept claiming his head touch the top of the bag and rejected me. Some Reddit users who works at AC counter claims they reject about 50% of pets. At this rate I would not risk it. Right away I booked porter and the difference was day and night. The person at the counter even felt bad I had to buy a very expensive last minute ticket and gave me free checked luggage. On my way back from yvr -> yyz I also already had an AC ticket. That was no problem but I could tell a certain people at the counter would give me problems. I just prayed to every God I would not get them. So you're pretty much in the mercy of the person you check in. I will never fly AC again if I'm bringing my pup. Which is too bad because I am used to flying exclusively AC for Aeroplan points. Now they will be my absolute last option. - [![Cristian](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/jbodEpJyxe/Cristian_Ion.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\ \\\\ Cristian\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ May. 21, 2024](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1855806) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) Horrible experience I flew a small rescue dog from Europe in the cabin.

I never had any issue with Alaska airline by far my favourite airline. AC counts pet carrier as your CARRYON LUGGAGE. It is absolutely absurd. How would one tiny dog be equal to a CARRYON LUGGAGE.

EXTREMELY HORRIBLE SERVICE. If I can give them a minus rating, I for sure would. I arrived at the airport 3 hours prior to my flight and was waiting in line for myself and my small dog to get check in. One staff came at the line and checked for my flight info. While we were waiting, one of the staff suddenly said the check-in is done, its closed now, and started to blame the rest of us for coming too late. At this time 2 hours remaining before departure. 15 minutes later, one of the staff suddenly came back and said just to hold on and we can continued on check-in. We were then moved to another check in counter while the guy line up behind us was okay to move forward and got check-in already. I was served by one of the old lady of Air canada and she said we came too late and said quote on quote \u201cTHERE IS NO WAY I WILL LET YOU IN\u201d. Even though I was told by one of her younger colleagues that I can still check in at this time, but then the old lady insisted on that she didn\u2019t want to do it, while looking at my poor dog whining inside the crate. There was some talkings back and forth between herself, the manager and other young staffs. And I guessed they couldn\u2019t persuade the old lady to let us in, so we had to re-book another flight. So a lesson is learned from this horrible experience: NEVER BOOK AIR CANADA if you plan to travel with your pet. If you ever come 2 hours before or 3 hours before, that is too late for them. From the manager who is heavily influenced by the senior strict staff, to the confusing young staffs, all creates a wonderful picture of a horrible airline. Minus rating for them and I don\u2019t think they even deserve it! - [![Kaitlin](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/sr24PES8Eh/KaitlinYung.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\ \\\\ Kaitlin\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1582838) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) Frequent Doggy Flyer almost denied boarding.

The agent said they were being more strict with the guidelines on the Air Canada website and that he should be denied boarding. This happened on the way back to YVR too. The guidelines on the website have always stated stricter rules in comparison to other airlines, but historically it has been up to the agent\u2019s discretion and they have been more relaxed.

Despite the fact that my dog is comfortable in his carrier and jumps in immediately without me asking, I was told that it was inhumane for him to be under the seat and that he would need to fly under the plane. The customer service agent told me that it was more humane for my dog to be separated from his owner under the plane despite the fact he was in a soft sided carrier which is not permitted for dogs going in cargo. Another review also noted that this happened to them. I did not further question the agent about my dog being allowed to fly in cargo in a soft sided carrier because I would never have allowed that but he very much gave me the impression that he did not know that dogs in cargo cannot be in soft sided carriers. In addition, a week after we were supposed to fly it came out that air canada had misplaced a dog flying cargo and the dog was found in the corner of an airport unattended hours after the flight had landed so I\u2019m not sure how this guy thought that my dog sitting at my feet for a one hour flight was inhumane when air canada losing a dog for hours was not but I guess air canada has different rules for logic than the rest of society. The customer service agent was rude and acted as though he knew more about my dog and what was best for him than I did. The only good thing that came from my experience was that I was able to get my money back however I will never be flying with air canada again with or with out my dog. The agents were rude and unhelpful to everyone.

When we explained that the dog was a regular flyer she responded with \u201c they can deal with it\u2026 not me\u201d. The customer service was quite shocking to us. We eventually got to an agent. The young agent immediately asked us to make the dog stand up in its cage which we did. Another agent walked over and said \u201c that dogs ears are too tall for the cage\u201d. We explained the dog is a regular flyer but this second agent refused to let the dog fly. Once again we explained that this dog is quite comfie in her cage and is able to turn around, move around and sleep comfortably Honestly if it was up to the young agent we first had we would have been fine and able to fly but the second agent was rude, uncaring and officious. So disappointed with Air Canada. We have been flight pass customers for many years but we will never fly with Air Canada again. Customer service was absolutely terrible and no one had any interest in helping us out at 6:00 am.

After being denied boarding by the gate agent noted above, I showed up for my rebooked flight with a carrier appropriate for use under the plane as well as my normal in-cabin carrier. I explained everything that happened to the agent at the time, who was super nice and did not see an issue with my pet in the in-cabin carrier. She promptly checked me in with my little guy in cabin and even checked with her supervisor just to be sure who concluded that the carrier was fine (I just ended up checking the big kennel as a bag since I had brought it with me). On the way back, this original gate agent, the poor excuse for a human being, had put notes in the file and cancelled my pet in cabin ticket however once again, when checking in at the airport, I explained the whole situation and the extremely nice and accommodating gate agent checked me in with the pet in the cabin. This is the more consistent experience I had with Air Canada and I can say, while terrible at the time, the one bad experience I had was due to one gate agent who lacks the ability to think and takes joy in making people's lives miserable and not Air Canada as a whole. To paint the whole airline with one brush because of one person's actions would be wrong and misleading. One can only hope this person is called out enough times for her inability to be a decent human being and removed from that organization. - [![Marla](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\ \\\\ Marla\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1007794) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) Terrible/Horrible/Will never fly again.

I was asked, at the time , for her weight and the size of her case. I had flown with her in February and didn't have a problem. I was told when denied checking in that she was too big to fly in the cabin(!!!!) and that she had to be able to stand fully and turn around. She is able to turn around, is very happy in her case (I have to pull her out to go through security). I looked at new cases in Florida and it appears that they are measured by the top of a dog's back, not their head. Regardless, because she couldn't stand fully upright in the case, I was denied boarding. I ran to West Jet where there was no problem and in fact larger dogs than mine where allowed on the plane in their cases. - [![Ashlyn](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\ \\\\ Ashlyn\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/887118) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg) Cargo + Carryon - great service+ amazing staff!!

However , our recent experience with AC Vancouver was horrendous . Now that AC insist on using IPATA agents instead of simply self booking and that is where our saga began . We found 4 IPATA members listed for Vancouver and we started our organising in June for our flights in November . Two never replied , one in the US gave us a ridiculous price so we chose Worldwide Pet transport . We had an initial quote which we thought expensive but thought it was the going rate . We lived very remotely in BC and had several questions about how it would all work. Tried emailing , phoning and even left a message on their \"Emergency\" hotline ( which is an answerphone!!! ). We emailed several times and finally asked for proof that they actually existed ...we haven't been answered since August !!! We finally gave up and found a UK firm Paws who were very helpful and they put us onto a professional transport company Seaair who were easy to deal with and very reassuring . The price was reasonable and they organised the document procedures . Air Canada have a strange policy of not confirming the Pet flight until 10 days prior to flying !! At day 8 Seaair had to call AC to get that confirmation . On the flight date we met a Fedex driver who had all the stickers etc for the pet crate and to present to the Cargo desk. With our little dog locked in and sitting on the counter the Air Canada rep simply pushed the papers back and said they were not the correct documents even although the Air Canada Air waiver Bill was purchased from Air Canada , Dorval!!!! He said we just had to move as there was a queue forming . Uncaring , unsympathetic doesn't quite cut it. Fortunately for us Philip Beck ( the Fedex driver) was also a travel agent and we could never lavish him with enough praise as he negotiated the system for the 45minutes it took for the AC staff to eventually concede that they were wrong and we had to rush to board ourselves. We have never been so stressed and will never use Air Canada in Vancouver again as the staff were uninformed but more importantly showed zero empathy for our pet or our predicament that was caused solely by them. WE also lodged a complaint to IPATA in the summer and never had a response !! - [![Mike](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\ \\\\ Mike\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/729961) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) The fee is a ripoff Air Canada charges a minimum of $50 to bring your small dog into the cabin AND this uses your normally free carry on baggage allowance... forcing you to pay for a checked bag (or higher fare to include a bag).

While some travelers had smooth flights with no issues, many others faced challenges, including their pets being denied boarding, even after previously flying successfully with the airline. Customers describe United as having strict and inconsistent policies around pet size and carrier requirements that agents enforce differently across flights and airports. Some travelers felt mistreated by rude and unhelpful staff. However, a few travelers had positive experiences with attentive and accommodating pilots and cargo staff. Overall, the reviews suggest United's pet policies and their application are unpredictable, making the airline a risky choice for those traveling with pets.

I flew alone and paid for two seats so there was more than enough room for the 3 of us. United is the only airline that will allow one person to fly with two dogs if you purchase an extra seat. I was even allowed to put the smaller dog carrier in my extra seat so I could sooth her because it was her first flight. In Raleigh, NC the agent just requested I expand the carrier for the larger dog so he'd have a little more room while we wait for our flight.

But zero for the check-in agent in Seattle who was incredibly rude and unreasonable. She wouldn\u2019t let us fly with our 10-pound dog (who has flown several times with United) because the dog was above the carrier when she lifted her head to look up. I tried to demonstrate to her how the dog was small enough to stand up and turn around inside the carrier when it was closed, but the agent refused to look. She said that we should just take her to Alaska Airlines and she would refund us the pet fee (but all five of us in the family could not get a refund!) We had to call a supervisor who fortunately was kind, allowed us to show him how the dog could stand and turn inside the carrier, and agreed that she could travel. United needs to train its agents, not just about what \"turning around in the carrier\" means (it\u2019s not the height of you the puppy with the head lifted looking up!!!!) but also about how to interact with customers. The agent was rude, condescending, and outright unprofessional even though we were very nice to her. Finally, we will never fly United again when we have our puppy (which is most of the time) - and maybe never, as this experience, despite the supervisor\u2019s help and kindness, has left us feeling mistreated and disrespected.

The last hr they were pretty restless. They did go on our laps for the middle 2-3 hrs. Flight attendants didn't care. Had lots of treats and marrow bones to chew on in their carriers. They were groomed prior to the flight so didn't look too big fluffy and we got lucky and were in the comfort plus seats which allowed more leg room. The middle and window seat had lots of room, the aisle I noticed was narrower at the feet. We go back to Boston in a month so let's hope check in goes smoothly in SFO. Domestic flights don't ask for health certificate or rabies certificate. Just the being able to turn in crate and look comfy. I wouldn't never do it for a trip less than 3-4 weeks. The cost is high and it's stressful. - [![Cameron](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\ \\\\ Cameron\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/719301) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) Denied Boarding for my 13 pound doodles I have two mini golden doodles, both are 13 pounds and are frequent flyers 50+ flights each. I was questioned by the checkin counter saying they can\u2019t stand up and turn around even though they can. The supervisor allowed them to go and I thought it was just a grumpy agent. I then mistakenly flew United again out of a different airport (Newark) and the same thing happened.

Depends on Check in Agent. Unsure whether to continue. We have been flying with our 16 pound non-shedding, quiet Havanese for 7 years with Southwest, with the same Sturdibag carrier that can flex and that he fits into easily. It fits under all seats. Most of the time it is not an issue. Flying back out of IAD the past few years, we get hassled each time about the size of the carrier and the fact that he cannot stand in it. The only dog that could stand in a carrier under Southwest's bag restrictions would be a very short Yorkie. Most CATS couldn't even meet that height limitation, and I'd love to see them try to get a cat to stand and turn on command. I'm pretty sure they don't make cats take that test, because it's stressful, and, well, cats. I don't think they'd allow a dachshund, because they'd argue it couldn't turn around easily. I'm a little concerned about the recent comments about DEN. I hate making long drives, but we have to reconsider if the airlines keep giving us a hard time. - [![Elisabeth](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\ \\\\ Elisabeth\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1441600) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) Southwest Airlines in Denver If I could give 0 bones for Southwest in Denver, I would. We have flown with my dogs 8 times without any problems, but this when I tried to fly out of Denver to CA, the Southwest Agent wouldn't let my husband and I fly with one of our dogs because he couldn't stand up and turn around in his carrier. It was the SAME carrier we had used the past 8 times! We told the Southwest Agent and her stupid Southwest Manager this, but they didn't care. The Manager asked if we could leave our dog with someone. We were checking in for a flight!!! Who would we ask to take care of our dog and pick him up from the Denver Airport?!! Our dog is 20 pounds with longer legs, but can lay down comfortably in the carrier. The spaces under the Southwest seats are small. What dog over 10 pounds can stand and turn around in their carrier when they are put under the seat!!! We had our dogs in a dog stroller while in the Denver Airport, which the Southwest Agent saw, and we don't put our dogs in their carrier until we board the plane. We ended up having to drive to CA. By the way, we were stuck at Denver Airport for 14 hours on Christmas 2022 because of the Southwest Airlines fiasco and we had our 2 dogs with us. Southwest didn't seem to care about our welfare let alone are dogs' welfare! We ended up missing Christmas with my family and again, we had to drive to CA. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me or should I say, fly on Southwest and get crapped on, shame on them, fly on Southwest again and get crapped a 2nd time, time to throw out the shovel and use a better airline!!!! - [![Jacs](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\ \\\\ Jacs\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1200583) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) Space under seat smaller than usual Flown with my dog countless times, always in the same carrier.

She flew in successfully from the Dallas location and the carrier fit great with us in the cabin. Heading back home to Dallas from Denver, they DENIED her check-in. They had stated she wouldn't be allowed to fly due to her size, even though she flew in with them. We were left STRANDED at their airport with no liabilities on their end and their sister location. They had no cargo and simply offered nothing but that \"they care about her wellbeing\" even though she flew in from their Dallas location with no apologies. Then they proceeded to pet our pup without our permission and asked if we wanted to still travel with them, knowing she wouldn't be able to travel back with us. WTF is that. Firstly, we wouldn't have traveled at all if our Corgi was denied beforehand. But the fact that she was accepted and now left stranded DUE TO THEIR ERRORS made it all a terrible experience.

Our pup is our only child. We have flown on SWA with him 3 times. I thoroughly reviewed the rules and was aware before traveling what was expected of me and my pup Grissom. We practiced from the time he was 12 weeks old sitting in the travel bag, he knows the drill. While Grissom did fine on the first two flights, the third flight left him a bit anxious (very likely due to my own stress levels). He began whimpering and scratching at mesh window in the bag. I unzipped it just enough to get my fingers into the bag so I could pet him, give him a treat and try to calm him. I was quickly scolded and told to zip the bag up COMPLETELY for the remainder of the flight. This only added to my stress level. My pup is whimpering and begging to poke his head out, and I am forced to sit silently and watch the miles and minutes tick by. It was heartbreaking. I won't do it again. I am so disappointed. I would be happy to pay for a first class ticket on any airline that would accommodate my child. I would gladly pay for a seat for my pup just to be allowed to keep him in a bag on a seat next to me. It saddens me that some flight crews fail to acknowledge that there are families, like mine, whose only child happens to be a pup and stuffing them under the seat and ignoring them like they're an inanimate object for a prolonged period just doesn't make one bit of sense. I live for the day when I can buy row of 3 seats for myself, my husband and our pup and fly comfortably, just as we do in a vehicle. Unfortunately, until then, it looks like we'll be driving. - [![Celeste](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/XDTdlvARRl/CelesteVillanueva.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\ \\\\ Celeste\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/637146) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg) Here's the skinny on pet carrier size on SWA I stumbled upon this website because I freaked out when I saw the pet carrier dimensions on SWA's website. Based on the majority of comments on this site stating the SWA pet carrier bottom is not sturdy enough, I got a small pet carrier. Luckily my puppy was 5.75 lbs. He fit ok, couldn't stand completely upright, but he could sit up right and had enough room to make himself comfortable. I originally bought the medium but didn't think it'd fit under the seat. I flew from Chicago to Tucson round trip. Google states SWA has a fleet of 737-800 and 737 MAX 8, and some older 737-700. I know I came back in a 737-800, and think I flew out in the same. Ok, getting to the point, the small carrier had more than enough room to fit under the seat in front of me. There was an additional 1\"-1.5\" of space above the carrier and roughly 2\" of space to the left and right of the carrier. I was able to slide my Coach shoulder bag (close to the size of a tote) next to the carrier. The medium could have easily fit. Additionally, the SWA team at MDW and TUS were so sweet to my puppy. I will say I Googled the heck out of traveling with a pet on a plane since this was my first time with a puppy I had for less than a week. I did the following: called SWA and they noted I was flying with a puppy, took early morning flights, got my puppy up an hour earlier than I'd typically get up for an early morning flight, played with him and gave him an extra potty break. Went on both airport websites and screen shot the locations of the pet relief areas, since I always check my carry-on no issues going to the counter to pay the $95 pet travel fee. You can't do it online or over the phone. In Chicago I stayed in the area 30min before the doors closed, I was Group C so what did I care. On the way back I paid for early bird check-in and kept him up until 11pm and woke him up at 5am. The morning of, he got a snack and as much water as he wanted. I gave him more snacks at the pet relief areas and offered water. I followed airport/SWA rules and only let him out of his carrier at security and the pet relief areas. He slept both ways. People around me were surprised a puppy was on board. I put the small and medium side by side, about 1.5\" taller in height, 1\" more in width, 2\" more in length. I know they have dimensions online but those are my visual measurements. I stressed way more than I needed. SWA made it stress free, and this is during a pandemic. So that's saying something. - [![Y](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\ \\\\ Y\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/155276) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) Ticketing staff is clueless regarding ESA.

They did have to allow one service dog that was there but no other dogs booked on that flight could go. (The person with the allergy still flew with the service dog so I'm not sure how concerned that person was about their allergy.)

Most, including travelers sitting next to us, on the plane are not aware that my pooch is on the plane ( His crate looks like luggage.). I pay the fares, I take care of my dog's elimination requirements and give him a strenuous walk instead of sedation to keep him sleeping. I have had no complaints. My dog has severe flea allergies, I keep him treated for this, but just one flea would set off weeks of intense scratching and skin infections. Boarding him is out of the question for me, and finding someone to dog sit is extremely difficult and expensive where I live.

We had no issues flying round trip from Miami (MIA) to San Juan Puerto Rico (SJU) and back with our dogs in the cabin. You can carry your pet in a carrier onboard along with a personal item (backpack). The pet carrier goes under the seat, and you will have to store your backpack overhead as there is only enough space under the seat for the pet carrier. When booking your flight online using the spirit app there is an option to add pets to your ticket, so you don\u2019t have to call the airline to do anything extra. Each person can carry one pet carrier and the cost is $125 each. You do have to check in formally at the departure agent desk. They don\u2019t ask you to take the dog out of the carrier. Going through security is alright; if you are flying from a busy airport Spirit has an add-on fast security pass you can buy while booking your ticket to let you go through first class/business class security (only specific airports). I have TSA pre check which is helpful. You have to take your dog out of the carrier to go through security. TSA does not have any relation with the airlines so they don\u2019t care what size your dog is. No one checked on our dogs after security. On our flight the person next to us in our row also had a dog! All three dogs did very well and no hassle from the airline. A relative of ours has taken two puppies via spirit from Houston (IAH) to Miami (MIA) without issue (in one carrier). Overall I think dog owners with dogs that are \u201cborderline\u201d size (you know who you are), you are at the mercy of the airline staff, and this may be airport dependent. I\u2019d encourage other reviewers to post the airports they use so we can all get an idea of which airports have more tolerant staff. We appreciate that Spirit staff are accommodating regarding pet policies and they can expect our continued business when traveling with dogs. - [Laurie\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1457438) Kicked off flight AFTER approved at check in!

They started escorting me off the plane but passengers who saw what they were doing started booing and make a fuss, so they let me sit up front in slightly bigger seats. Carrier still stuck out as far.\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f - [daniel \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1409675) Spirit Airline scam Pet fee was partially refunded. The other half was posted in a visa card not associated to me. Somehow, Spirit Airlines took my refund for themselves and will not help me resolve this matter. Instead, they are giving me the business, placing fault to a 3rd party, but I know best. I directly book my pet fee through Spirit. It's been over 1 hr on hold to speak to supervisor. He stated he could not help me and refused to reverse the charges since it has been released to what he claim to be a 3rd party. Keep in mind, I made the pet reservation directly through Spirit and not through a 3rd party. The 3rd party has no information about the pet fee at all or any refunds owed to me. In conclusion, never deal with Spirit Airlines when traveling with a pet. They are not your friend. They will take as much money from you if given the opportunity. - [Marian\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1253832) Great Experience I visited Miami early December & flew with Spirit airlines. I was a bit scared about the boarding process with my dog because I had only taken flights with Southwest Airlines. The entire process from checking in my dog, to boarding was so smooth with Spirit. I\u2019ve experienced nightmare stories with Spirit before but can honestly say they are a dog friendly airline. I also used the Sherpa pet carrier size large & it fit perfectly under the seat! - [Sabine\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1163460) Travel with MyBun I recently started traveling with my domestic Bunny on Spirit. What sold me was their reply to pets on the plane: no pets will ever be sent to the cargo. Every person that met him on the plane adored him and treated him with love and care. His pet carrier fit just fine under the seat. He was calm thought out the flight. The Crew was patient and helpful. I have flown 2xs so far (due to work) and have had no issues. Just a pleasant experience. - [Lisa\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/639076) Excellent experience Ok, I have read a lot of bad reviews for flying with a pet on Spirit so I want to say my piece here. They were so friendly and easy at the ticket counter. I have a 14 lb Pom terrier mix. His back pack was 18x14x9 which are the requirements for the airplane. They checked us in said hi to my pup and told me all about their fur babies and off we went! Easy and friendly. He fit perfectly under the seat and the stewardesses were so sweet and kind. They definitely don\u2019t deserve all the bad reviews they are getting. We need to post the good stuff too. Also if people are pushing the rules and think they can walk on with a carrier or dog that doesn\u2019t meet the requirements then you can\u2019t except to be accommodated! I also recommend the Mr.Peanut backpack carrier on Amazon. It can lay under the seat and sit upright when not under the seat. It\u2019s sturdy and light with lots of great pockets and padding. - [Tasha\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/970722) No hassel I flew to Houston Texas from California to get my puppy. My first flight was canceled about 6 hours before departure so I had to cancel the whole trip. I waited a few days and decided to give Spirit another try so I booked again. My first flight there was uneventful. My return flight with the puppy was not so great. I was told to check in at the desk even though I had already been given a electronic boarding pass just for them to print another of the same exact boarding pass. Upon check in I was asked of I was aware of my flight delay and I said no. I was told that my flight was delayed 2 hours. I wasn't happy but proceeded through security to wait at my gate. There was no mention of the puppy on my boarding pass so I asked a Spirit gate if they could confirm my carry on pet which they did. My flight home had delay after delay after 3 different gate changes I was very relieved to get on the plane to head home. I had a very small carrier for my less than 1 pound puppy and placed it under the seat with my small personal backpack and I was very uncomfortable with no space at all. Im only 5'4\" and I had no space to put my feet at all. With the TSA limits of liquids I was only allowed to bring very little wet food for my puppy which didn't last long after several hours of delays for what was supposed to be a 3 hour trip home so I had a cranky puppy. The flight was freezing both there and back not comfortable at all. I was very disappointed in my experience with Spirit and I do not recommend people with pets to choose this airline. There is no space at all. On a positive note the staff was friendly but a friendly staff isn't enough for me to ever fly Spirit again. They are known for their cancelations and delays (I wasn't aware until I was upset and started researching) so consider that as well - [Alexis\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/837353) Don\u2019t do it (9/2021) I\u2019ve been traveling with my 6 year old doodle since she was 6 months old (for 5 years as an ESA and now as a pet in cabin). She is 15lbs and we use the Sherpa carrier. When I tell you I\u2019ve never, ever had an issue flying with her, I mean it. She\u2019s been on at least 40 flights with me on every airline under the sun. Come today, I was checking in at Spirit for a one way flight and they asked to see her in the carrier, fair. I put her in and zipped it up. The lady then proceeds to tell me because her head touches the top of the carrier when she stands, she cannot fly with me. She suggested I buy a bigger carrier and come back, which doesn\u2019t even makes sense bc a taller carrier wouldn\u2019t fit under the seat. That was it, nothing I could do. They refunded me and I booked a flight a few hours later on delta. No problem. Flew jet blue on the first leg of my trip, also no problem. I don\u2019t understand how her head touching the top of the carrier has any impact on her ability to fly with me. She has plenty of space and can move around freely. Don\u2019t fly spirit with your pet. - [Sean\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/549289) Denied at check-In My 15 week, 15 pound puppy was denied at check-in today, as I was told his carrier was too small for him. His carrier is approved for dogs twice his size. He was sprawled out fully and asleep and they wanted me to wake him up and make him around. They were completely unwilling to work with me and told me even if I got a bigger carrier he couldn\u2019t fly because the carrier would be too big. I had two dogs with me and one is an ESA. I had to go through complete hell to get Spirit to approve her papers even though I submitted 10 days before the flight. DO NOT CHOOSE SPIRIT FOR PETS AND ESA! The first check-in agent told us the carrier was fine and then another one came along and said it was not. This was a case of someone having a bad day and having a power trip to ruin ours. We\u2019ll never fly with Spirit again. We have reported the employees that was dealt with at check-in and I demanded a full refund and got it. If they tell you you cannot get a refund, keep asking for a supervisor and demand it and you will get it. They have the ability to give you your money back if they screw you over so get your money back and choose another airline. - Katrina More than a year ago Poor service Very disappointed with Spirit. Booked my flight online (which didn't ask for pets) so when I called to add him to my ticket they said they could not accommodate my dog due to the 4 pet limit per flight they have. While I 100% understand this rule, I was not aware that they had reached the limit at the time of my booking. They said I can still fly WITHOUT my dog or change my flight and pay for the difference ($150+) in addition to the pet in cabin fee ($110) in addition to my original flight cost ($139). I had also originally paid extra to select my seat and lost that payment with the flight change- couldn't even get a refund! Very unfortunate being as I would have gone with another airline had I known I would have to pay this!! Outrageous. Load More Reviews"

We investigated and found AA and Delta would transport him but in cargo which could not be scheduled till 14 days before the flight. In addition cargo charges were based on weight and distance well over 500 dollars. Alaska adds your dog the same time you make your reservations and you pay 150 when you check the dog in no matter the distance so long as kennel and dog weight less than a 100 pounds. Once the dog is boarded they give you a card indicating the dog is on board. One of our flights the plane was changed and not all planes have room.

The worst part was I never knew the cost until she arrived in Anchorage. Terrible customer service and I live here, use Alaska Airlines credit card and club 49 member.

The first happened in May 2021. Super thankful they were allowing people to fly with their dogs. However, once I get to my location, I find out that they put your dogs out by the baggage claim with no one watching them. My fianc\u00e9 thankfully came into the airport that day to surprise me and saw our dog in a place where anyone could steal him. He literally got him out of the cage and no one stopped him from \u201cstealing\u201d our dog. It took me 30 minutes to get to them\u2026 I thought to myself, maybe it\u2019s because it is a smaller airport. So return flight home, going to a big name airport and surprise, surprise, they do it again. This time I had no one to see him first, so literally anyone could have taken him. The only reason security came to us was because someone was using a lighter to take off the zip ties. They never checked to see if we were the owners. Now, the most recent thing. Online they do mention something about restricting some flights around the holidays. So I call and ask about this and the customer service person said it was good for me to book tickets and my dogs could come with me. So I book them and then try to talk with someone else to hold my dogs\u2019 spots. 45 minutes later she said she couldn\u2019t do it. I had already wasted 2 hours to be told something I asked about in the beginning. I then ask to speak to someone higher up, and the lady was rude and not empathetic at all about the situation and blamed it on the company not sending out the policy yet. I got a refund from them thankfully but when I said I didn\u2019t want to ever fly with them again, she chuckled and said okay then. So bad overall job taking care of dogs in cargo and bad customer service. Run away from this company!!!! - [![Zoie](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\ \\\\ Zoie\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/785837) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg) I am happy I filed oversea twice from States with Alaska with my husky.

I also checked private pet transport and found it to be too risky. I have flown Alaska many times and found their service to be superior. Not to mention on time flights. I called customer service to check their dog policies and which planes my lab could be booked on. They were very patient and helpful and I finally got us all booked on the flight. We flew first class so we could deplane quickly and pick up our lab. I hadn't slept properly for 2 months after reading horror stories on the internet about dogs in the hold of planes. But Alaska more than delivered on their promise. My lab was treated carefully and I was thrilled to see so many dog lovers among their staff. The fantastic customer service began with the agents who checked us in at San Jose, to the stewardess on the plane who listened patiently and offered to tell the captain that there was a passenger with her lab in the hold. I saw my lab being driven in a white air conditioned van to be loaded on the plane. I received confirmation she was on the plane and she was off the plane within 5 minutes of landing. I don't know why people complain about the $100 fee for dogs on a plane, cargo or not. The alternative is private transport which is 10X or more expensive, or leaving your dog behind. If you want your dog to be well taken care of, b\u00f3ok with Alaska. Your experience might not be as great as mine as a lot depends on your dog's temperament and personality, but the airline will do a great job. Thanks, Alaska, for taking such good care of my dog.

That's dirt cheap, When took my dog from St. Louis to Seattle and back again, the crew couldn't have been nicer. Both my dog and I were treated with in a welcoming and respectful manner, and it made our trip all the more enjoyable. I have never had a bad experience on Alaska Airlines. Just never. From check-in to deplaning, the service has always been top notch. I can't say that about any other airline, and I've flown them all. Like a lot of folks, I take whatever flight is cheapest, but I am always extremely happy when Alaska pops up as the lowest fare, and that's been happening some frequency lately. As for the issue of folks flying with dogs, so long as pet owners are reasonable (and I understand that can be a big if), it shouldn't be a problem. A German shepherd doesn't belong in the cabin, but no one should be upset by a pug or small poodle, so long as the dog is well behaved. If you have a dog that yaps or can't control its bowels, then you should leave it home. If folks have allergies, then they can be separated from the dog. I've never seen more than one animal on a plane, and I fly a fair amount. I'm quite certain that if someone near me had an issue with allergies, flight attendants, at least on Alaska, would have put as much distance between me and the allergic passenger as possible. Frankly, I think the issue of dogs on planes exacerbating allergies is somewhat of a red herring. I have yet to read an account of a passenger who was allergic to dogs having an issue due to a dog being on a plane, and I've read a fair amount. - ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg) Kimberly More than a year ago ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg) Thanks Alaska Airlines!

Westjet\u2019s representative confirmed that our dog would be able to come as long as he was healthy. No further information was shared, by the representative. We booked a flight accordingly to avoid any extra charges with other airlines and to make the trip seamless for our little dog. The flight was bought through Westjet, and contained 2 flights, the second of his was operated by Delta Airlines. However, when it came to booking our dog on the flight, Westjet shared they were not able to add him on the flight because they have a rule which indicates that pets cannot be booked via Westjet if there are 2 separate carriers (in our case Westjet and Delta Airlines). This was never shared to us before. The only rationale we were given is that this is just Westjet\u2019s rule. We were not given the right information from the beginning. If this was the case we would have made other arrangements beforehand for our dog or booked flights accordingly.

There have been times where a Westjet agent may not be as enamoured with having to process your pet (Maybe not a dog lover) but overall, the experience has been good. My only negative that I always hope that Westjet will change is allowing your pet to come off \"first\" vs the \"luggage\" when flying into a smaller airport - ie. Victoria or Comox airport. My dog was super stressed flying and it's a long day for your pet and for the owner and now that they landed, you are having to wait until all that luggage comes off before your very anxious pet gets reunited. I do love how they give you the confirmation that your pet is on board (sometimes they need reminding) but overall they care. - [![Val](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\ \\\\ Val\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/881511) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) #1 HERDING DOG REFUSED FLIGHT TO ATTEND COMPETITION I would give a 0 rating if possible. Thanks to WestJet, Marshall and I are unable to fly to Vancouver island for the year end competition. We were booked to fly from Calgary and when I went to check in, they weighed him and his kennel and denied board because he was slightly over the limit. I was instructed to ship him cargo. I booked Marshall\u2019s cargo ticket for travel the following day and changed my flight as well. I arrived at the Cargo office at 6:20 am, 3 1/2 hours before the flight departed to make sure he got checked in and I could get to the main terminal and through security for my flight. After sitting in the cargo office for two and a half hours they told me his shipment was rejected because he is too big for his kennel. So my 25 inch, 85 pound dog was not able to travel on WestJet, period. Website indicates cargo accepts pets up to 160 pounds. Dog has to be able stand, turn around and lay down which he does. He is a show dog and this is his regular kennel. I couldn\u2019t cancel my flight because the timeline had passed to do so online and we all know what the wait times are when you try to call! Yay more time out of my life I\u2019ll never get back to deal with that. Inconsistently applied rules don\u2019t make for happy customers. Similar sized dogs travelling to the competition were either not weighed, or granted some leeway. My dog was 5 pounds over the 100 pound \u201climit\u201d and considered \u201ctoo big\u201d for cargo shipment. So I missed the competition and had to forfeit entry fees and other show expenses. Another exhibitor had a similar issue. It took WestJet 2 days to decide whether her dog would be accepted to fly. What happened WestJet?

So thankful for this allowance in flight , as we are gone for a month at a time in the winter and couldn't be without my pup.

On the 3rd flight I had a very difficult time getting her on board as they said she didn't fit into her carrier. The same carrier that she voluntarily sleeps in each night. I leave it open in our front entry and she spends her naps times and nights comfortably in it. I was sternly warned that I would not likely be permitted to fly with her in the cabin again as she was not able to sit up inside of her kennel. This is not true and it is the opinion of one person who has now flagged me and when I check in with her in the future I will inevitably have to get a supervisor to assure that things are OK. However, I had zero trouble with her on previous flights. All flights are 1 hour and 17 minutes in duration. Even after sharing how our pooch is more then happy to go inside, turn around, sit (she lays down almost immediately because this is where she naps. The counter agent made me feel awful and that I was abusing my precious pup. She is 12 and has travelled via car on 3 day trips and was a former show pup, so she is used to being out of her element. She navigates the airport happily and actually chooses to rest in her carrier while we wait. I have 3 pre-paid flights with her on the reservation but I am worried that I will be denied boarding, which will definitely be a huge hassle. I spoke with West Jet customer care and they said that if I want assure her boarding, I should place her in cargo. I am just frustrated that I have without any hassle travelled with this airline and because of one persons unwilling to be reasonable I am going to be forced to purchase yet another airline approved hard-sided kennel. I will now have 3 crates/carriers. Being inconsistent with their policy makes me worry that maybe they are inconsistent with other aspects of their airline. I have been a raving fan of West Jet up until this most recent experience. - ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg) Carol More than a year ago ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg) 80lb gsd When my Gsd was a puppy we travelled from cabo San Lucas to Edmonton, I was so amazed at the quality of service given by westjet, especially the hostess bringing me the receipt to my seat to say that my dog had been loaded on the plane, phew what a relief I was worried that he would not get loaded in cargo. Made my flight even more relaxed. But unfortunately my gsd has outgrown westjet said size limititations he now needs the 700 series giant kennel and westjet does not accept that size.

All had to be checked baggage and only 3 flights per dog. Booked our reservation over the phone- Don't book online as you need to confirm they are on the flight with you. Arrive early (3 hours) so you can book them in We had great staff, petting them, asking if they could have treats etc. while we booked them in. No issues. One dog was slightly overweight so asked us to put her in a lighter crate (switch dog/crate we had) so we did but no issue. They were really good in Canada and Mexico. It can be done!

I have flown JetBlue almost exclusively since they started the airline. My family members and friends all fly with their dogs on JetBlue and have never had any issue. They allow you to have the bag out on your lap, with the exception of take off and landing which is a rarity in air travel. Most airlines make you keep the dog under the seat the entire flight. I have been in close proximity of people traveling with their small dogs both in the JetBlue terminal at JFK, in the gate waiting areas of airports across the country and on the plane. The JetBlue employees that I have experience have been nothing but nice to everyone--- even those who scatter the waiting area floor with wee wee pads and those who walk their dogs all around inside the terminal. In 2003, 15 years ago, before ESAs were a \"thing,\" I was prescribed an ESA to help with my GAD and PTSD. Since I had been flying with JetBlue for a few years at that point, I continued to do so with my ESA. I was diagnosed with cancer a few years later and my ESA was medically alert trained as a service dog. When my dog died in 2016, I adopted another in early 2017. She became my ESA and is currently finishing her medical alert training now that she is over 2 years old. I can tell you that JetBlue has gone above and beyond anytime I have flown with them, which is quite often. My dog who turned 2 years old on November 21st will fly her 10th and 11th flights later this week and 12th and 13th flights in early February. To the reviewer who said her dog is an ESA but she doesn't want to go through the whole ordeal of submitting paperwork to JetBlue, you cannot pay for your dog to fly and then expect JetBlue to allow you to keep the bag open with your dog's head out as that is something reserved for people who actually take five minutes to submit the paperwork. It's actually a very easy process for anyone who sees their mental health professional regularly, needs an ESA for their wellbeing and who is a good pet owner and takes their dog to the vet on an annual basis (and gets them vaccinated for rabies like anyone owning a dog should). Literally, it's a short form that the mental health professional fills out, and one that the vet fills out and one that you fill out self certifying that your dog is basic trained to behave. and then you upload to the JetBlue portal. Quite simple, if you ask me. My dog has been through basic 1, 2 and 3 training, has one-on-one sessions with a trainer often and we work with the dog hours each day on her medical alert training, so 5 minutes of our time to comply isn't a big deal. I've found the people who have issues are the ones who bought a fake letter online and are angry they can no longer scam JetBlue vs. actually go to a therapist on a regular basis and have determined that an ESA would be a good coping mechanism in conjunction with ongoing therapy. Personally, I believe that anyone traveling with a dog including service dog handlers should be required to submit the vet paperwork and self certification, too, as people tend to have their dogs out in the airport. And, there are so many people I've come into contact with faking service dogs. I have found JetBlue to be absolutely amazing as someone who travels often and very accommodating to those with dogs. - [![Andrea](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\ \\\\ Andrea\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/107574) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) \u201cWorld class service\u201d is lacking I fly often for work, and for personal trips at least once a quarter with my cat Fluff. We have flown exclusively with JetBlue for 9 years (2 years for her). These last few trips have been just aweful. We fly in the \u201ceven more room\u201d seats, I check my bag so I just carry her and a small purse even though her tickets are $125 each way. Never any promotions on her tickets. She IS an ESA, but I prefer to buy her ticket so we\u2019re not constantly at the vet getting paperwork and I don\u2019t mind paying, for the most part. However, she flys in her bag on my lap between takeoff and landing. Non negotiable. She likes to put her head out of the hand hole and lay on my heart to calm the both of us. She\u2019s in her bag, except for a \u2018sunroof\u2019 of sorts. I ALWAYS check with any row mates to be sure they\u2019re okay with this when we board the plane. This last attendant was SO rude about it. I\u2019m sorry that I do not want to disclose my anxiety to the ENTIRE PLANE when I\u2019m being chastised like a child because my calm quiet cat has her head on my chest. HIPPA laws prevent patient infor to be shared and it\u2019s a trigger point for me to HAVE to make a case and display my documents aboard a flight where I\u2019ve paid for tickets. It clearly states that this is okay on your ESA rules and regulations. If your in flight service staff have a problem, I can be spoken to in calm quiet tones not shouted at while manning a drink cart. I was about to buy my ritual cocktail, but I will not spend another dollar with your airline. I will not fly JetBlue again. I am embarrassed, my cat is upset and I can\u2019t calm my anxiety, this is not \u201cworld class service\u201d. - [![Donna](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\ \\\\ Donna\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/55391) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) Jet Blue ESA Rules Are Biased I have a Jet Blue credit card and fly with Jet Blue almost exclusively. I was just booking a flight for me and my new ESA dog Zoe, and noticed that massive amounts of documentation are required for the ESAs, but not so for the passenger pets (with $200 tickets). To travel with an ESA, you need to submit a form signed by a doctor about the need for an ESA, a customer acknowledge form for the ESA need, and a vet form of good health. Nothing like that is needed for passenger dogs unless they fly internationally. The only important document for an ESA is the doctor letter that shows the need for the ESA. I am submitting that. I just hope Jet Blue doesn't say: \"Oh but you need to submit the special Jet Blue doctor form\" because that would mean I have to bug my doctor to fill out an extra form for \"just this trip\"! Jet Blue doesn't hold on to this information either. It has to be submitted each time. So Jet Blue, stop making trouble for ESAs! - [![K](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\ \\\\ K\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/2155) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) Federal regulations, traveling with pets I, too, am a jetblue flight attendant. I love animals and have four fur babies at home. I understand that traveling is stressful, on customers and their pets. We (crew members) are not the ones who write the regulations and policies though we are required to follow them or face federal fines. Some crew members look the other way and don\u2019t always enforce regulations. All of us should, as we are required by the FAA. Due to inconsistencies, the crew members who do their jobs following regulations and policies are looked at as the mean flight attendants. I love my job but we are here for everyone\u2019s safety and not to make \u201cnice\u201d with every person and pet that travels. I can\u2019t afford to be fined by the FAA for breaking regulations. They are in place for a reason. It is unfortunate that people don\u2019t understand that we are just doing our jobs. I would never travel with my pets and disregard the policies, procedures and regulations regarding travelling with them and expect other passengers or the crew members to allow me to do so. Why put someone in a position where they would have to remind you of the rules and regulations? If you can\u2019t follow simple rules then please don\u2019t travel with your pets. If you do, don\u2019t expect your crew to not enforce regulations just because the Crew on a previous flight may not have. Shame on the flight attendants who don\u2019t do their jobs as required. I\u2019ll continue to do so regardless of how \u201cmean\u201d you think it is! - ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg) Dawn More than a year ago ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg) Hurricane Maria catastrophe and need for more exact policy This story is about the need for JetBlue to be more specific about exceptions to the one animal per carrier rule. For example in transporting small kittens (who can't go in cargo on any airplane due to their fragility)...if is not prudent to separate small kittens as they draw body heat and comfort from each other. If a carrier can take an animal up to 17 pounds, why not allow 3 kittens under 2 pounds each? The story below highlights how dangerous it can be to say yes \"on a case by case basis\" and not make it a general rule that very small animals can travel together. I am in the animal rescue field and often transport animals. After helping to evacuate the entire St. Thomas Humane Society of 200 animals, I was flying back to Boston via San Juan the day prior to Hurricane Maria hitting PR, with three 1.5 pound kittens who were too young to have traveled through the long evacuation process we had in place. I felt they would be safer with me and bought them a under seat. At 1.5 pounds, they easily fit in the JetBlue carrier I owned. Leaving San Juan the day prior to Hurricane Maria, I was nervous about getting out of the city. I called and asked a Jetblue rep over the phone if my three kittens would be OK to fly in one carrier, since more than one animal was considered on a case to case basis. She said yes. I had also traveled with kittens before: no one has ever asked me to divide them into separate carriers. So, I arrive on the crowded airport well before my flight, wait on a long line at the help desk to process my kitten ticket and the man tells me that I cannot fly with 3 kittens, that the policy is a firm one animal per carrier. I say it says \"case by case basis\" and there are exceptions. He takes a full 45 minutes (meanwhile, there is a natural disaster coming and people are still trying to get flights and get out). I was filled with panic and incredulity that there was this amount of concern about three 1.5 kittens when a hurricane would tear up the city within 24 hours. I asked for a supervisor. An hour later, and only because of the impending disaster, was I allowed on the flight. It wasted time and effort and it absolutely terrified me. It also made me wonder if some people could not get out of San Juan because of the ridiculous hold up that this caused.... - ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg) Bill More than a year ago ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) Just okay Jet blue needs more leg space anyway.

We occupied the entire three seats and the aisle seats next to my row with the 10 pound hypo allergenic Maltese and my kids. On flight from EWR to MCO the crew was outstanding. I kept the dog in her carrier on the floor until after lift off then she was much more comfortable in the carrier with my hand until liftoff but on my lap until landing. Since I had the entire row we bothered no one. On the way home we had the opposite experience. We had one attendant that which insisted the dog stay on the floor the entire time and she could not even poke her head out of the carrier. It was a HORRIBLE flight. I paid I think $200 round trip to bring her and expect some sort of compassion. Also it was only one attendant that was the issue. The rest almost looked at me and felt bad for the situation I was in because my dog was scared. Unless I knew which crew I was getting they will not get my business for family flight again.

An employee held us up for 1 hour and 40 minutes, putting up every possible obstacle. I had all the correct documentation for the dogs and he asked for a document that was not required on the company website (a veterinary certificate translated into the language of the destination country - I already had it in Vietnamese and English, and in my country they do not ask for this in the local language). When I questioned the lack of this information on the website, he told me that I should go to the airport and speak to him when I purchased the ticket, because there is internal information that only employees have access to and this specific document was one of them. I had already purchased seats next to each other for my family, I paid extra for this and this employee rebooked the seats, placing my family 5 rows apart and said that it was company policy when passengers travel with dogs. If the company is pet friendly, it has a duty to train its employees so that they do not instill in passengers a repulsion towards animals. - [![Karen](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/FLhQZSn2z7/KarenJane.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\ \\\\ Karen\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1501296) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) WORST AIRLINES EVER!

We booked our flights, made the payment and I called back to add our dog to our booking. I was advised this was no problem and I would receive an email soon. Within minutes of getting off the phone, we received an email to advise that our pet could not be added to the booking. I rang back and was advised that low an behold, it was not possible to take our pet on that flight. I asked when it would be possible, she advised that it would not be possible for a few days after we were planning to fly, but it may be possible on the Monday, however, she could not confirm until we tried. It was going to cost EUR 200 plus to change our flight booking, without any guarantee that our pet would then be allowed on that flight. In the end I have asked them to cancel the booking. I am unsure if we will receive a full refund, they were also unable to confirm this. We are currently waiting to receive the refund. We will never use this airline again for flying with our pet!

The flight crew has been always very pet friendly and accomodating. You must receive approval for the pets you plan to travel with by calling Turkish Airlines call center and the call center registers your pet to your flight. Unfortunately you cannot add your pet to your flight online. Since the number of pets allowed for in-cabin traveling is limited, I would recommend to contact the call center before you book your flight. The airline asks for your dog's health certificate while you check-in for your flight and they make a copy for their own records. As mentioned at the very beginning of this review, we highly recommend Turkish Airlines for stress-free traveling with your dog in-cabin. We didn't have any experience with dogs traveled in the cargo department , hence cannot comment on that. Load More Reviews"

My husband and I flew with our two little red poodles on June 4th and 26th nonstop (each way) a 4-hour flight at night. The flights were packed and our dogs were in their required travel bags. This was their first flight vacation and they really did a great job. Taking the dogs through security and check-in was very easy. At the baggage check area and the gate everyone was cordial and we had no trouble. Having never done this and reading different reviews I was concerned that there may be certain issues and I was nervous. Planning well in advance made a big difference. Prior to the flight I had a health certificate issued and all their worming and vaccinations, of course, were up to date. The health certificate was never an issue when we were on the flight or while we were checking in. Something I would do differently though in the future, definitely make sure that if you're traveling from one part of the country to the other or for sure if you fly internationally, only let your dogs drink bottled water and no local water whatsoever. Our dogs drank local water and were sick for 2 weeks. This has nothing to do with the airline of course but it's just a little bit of advice I would pass along. I would also say if you have any antibiotics on hand, you may consider bringing them along. If not, plan on visiting an animal hospital or a vet on your trip. As far as the Frontier airlines is concerned, we were very impressed, the whole process was easy and we found the whole staff to be polite and professional both on board and off. I would recommend getting the larger legroom seats. If you're flying with a pet, you're not allowed to sit in an emergency exit row. All passengers can check in with the Frontier app or login and choose their seats in advance if they like for slightly more and get comfortable seating. I highly recommend this especially when you have a pet carrier at your feet for the whole flight and if your flight is as long as ours were. - [![Gozde](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/IoGyDsJ79M/asid10160961163814428height50width50ext1626181875hashAeQqHmdfN98n5tNcr1I?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\ \\\\ Gozde\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/719365) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) Tina at DFW I have had the worst experience with this airline. Previously I have flown with my small puppy five times with other airlines. However when I first approach the desk I was asked if I am going around picking up dogs from different countries by the lady named Tina who claims to be the floor manager. I don\u2019t understand what kind of manager can ask that kind of a question. It\u2019s just poor customer service. I\u2019ve never faced such hostility before. She was not even the agricultural health inspection person to be asking me this sort of question. When I asked for another manager she refused. She also continued to refer to my Turkish passport when she was making claims about my dog as if it matters if I am American or Turkish. I simply think this customer service is the worst. I was faced with racism, bigotry and hostility. I was also faced with questions that carry the conversation to a different level. She pacifically said \u201cI mean really are you just going around picking up dogs from different countries\u201c. I\u2019ve had all of my health certificates for my dog and she claimed that these were insufficient (have use the same documents every time I fly with my dogs). My documents includes US Department transportation air transportation animal form, it also includes rabies certificates, it includes animal health certificates and it includes that she was checked just the day before the flight to make sure that she was OK to go. I also have a list of every single treatment that my dog has received for the past six months. She even claimed that I printed them off and I signed them myself instead of the certified vet. I highly suggest flying with American Airlines instead of this airline \u2014 just spend a couple more bucks and have a pleasant experience. If there is any suggestions on how to give feedback on an employee of Frontier Airlines I would highly appreciate it.

However, we had an absolutely AWFUL experience today. Apparently, Hawaiian Airlines had updated their policy to require that dogs flying in-cabin must be able to stand in an upright manner (their heads held at neutral, above-body height) while in their carrier. With a carrier height restriction of a measly 9.5\", this is impossible for most dogs. When we called to reserve a spot for our dogs, we were only told the usual (i.e. carrier and weight limitations, and that dogs must be able to comfortably turn around and lie in their carrier). When we tried to check in with an agent at the guest services counter, she immediately glared at us and told us that she won't allow our dog on the plane. She was completely unsympathetic, unfriendly, and unhelpful. Her only solution was to leave and come back with a hard-sided carrier to throw her in cargo. After debating for some time, we just left and ran into another agent who was able to assist us and was extremely apologetic. Furthermore, the first agent almost denied entry for our tiny 8 pound dog! I completely understand that dogs should not be stuffed into a carrier without any space to move, but their new policy is way too strict. Just be warned that you may be denied entry if you encounter the wrong guest agent! - [![Summer](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/ZrBJhx36l8/SummerDien.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\ \\\\ Summer\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1582956) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) Hawaiian Airlines new pet carrier policy doesn\u2019t make sense I flew from Maui OGG to Kauai LIH with my cat and she was taller than 9.5\u201d (which is the max height for the soft sided pet carrier) and they were giving me a hard time because she couldn\u2019t stand in her carrier.

Luckily my wife is skilled at working with entitled people as a hotel front desk agent. She was able to stroke the lady\u2019s egos just enough to get our dogs processed in time. We almost missed our connecting flight to Maui from California because the quarantine employees seemed to have some office drama going on between them.

At the Services desk, where one needs to check in with a pet, I was immediately denied because the agent said my 12 pound dog could not comfortably stand in his soft-sided kennel. Mind you, this is a regulation-size soft sided kennel in which he travels to and from Boston on two 6-hr legs usually via Seattle on excellent Alaska Airlines. We make the round trip twice annually and use the very kennel in which he arrived to HNL on a Hawaiian flight 51 hours ago. Speaking of his fellow Kona-based HA agents he said \u201cthey were wrong\u201d to allow me to depart Kona, that there were new rules implemented on June 1 and, other than presenting a printed sheet of paper showing Hawaiian\u2019s new policy, was unwilling to assist me. Distressed and nearly furious, I awaited another agent who at least had the good sense to contact a supervisor. About 30 minutes later (!) a supervisor named Wendy approached, apologized for her delay, explained the policy and allowed me to check in. The new policy apparently does not allow a pet whose head would extend above the carrier when unzipped to travel in the cabin. So you might be able to travel with a 5 pound Chihuahua or heavier low-slung dog. If this BringFido site still shows the image of a small, bright-eyed white canine with its head extending through its soft-sided kennel then BEWARE of travel on Hawaiian with any pet similar in size. My little guy is smaller than that and we almost got stranded at HNL, trying only to return home on a 49 minute flight. - [![Susan](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/895002/asid481959382342968height50width50ext1557607594hashAeTPlxNUUaPpGfZn?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\ \\\\ Susan\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/177529) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) Hassled every time in Oahu I have traveled many times with my Dogue De Bordeaux as a service dog and know all the rules and paperwork required....Hawaiian Airlines in Kona and Hilo and Seattle are wonderful...every time I have to go through Oahu even on inter\u2019-island they are rude and try to tell me why my dog cannot go on the airplane....inter-island Oahu asked for my paperwork...the only thing they are allowed to ask me is does my dog provide a service and what that is...This time I got right in her face and all of a sudden my dog was allowed through without them needing anything...interesting.

Little did we know when adopting him that nobody would fly him back to Massachusetts for us.... except Hawaiian. We flew Shamu home via cargo and he was just fine! The Humane Society was incredibly helpful in ensuring that we had all the correct paperwork for Shamu - but made one small mistake on his medical sheet. It wasn't a huge problem they quickly drew us up a new one and we ran over to get it (Only a few miles away). If you make sure you get to your flight early and you have the proper paperwork easy peasy! I attached a nice little letter introducing himself to the airline staff and a little bag of candy for them as well. They treated our boy with much aloha and he had a great flight home.

I checked in 3 hours before my flight from San Diego to Honolulu and they made me wait 2 hours while they went to process authorization. They then said they would make an exception and let me fly. I should have made them not make the exception as the Federal complaint was excused because the airline did allow me to fly. Big deal, they just got away with discrimination and will continue to do this over and over again. I guess they truly don't want to accept pets and if so, them they should just NOT do it. Also, it is NOT Hawaii Quarrantine that doesn't allow the pets in the cabin as many are told. It is the AIRLINES who are refusing to allow the pets in cabin into Hawaii. Kudos to ALASKA AIR.

We have actually decided to not fly Hawaiian anymore into Hawaii because they will not allow,our dogs in the cabin with us. I have tried very hard to speak with their public relations/customer service people at corporate to try to change this, but they absolutely will not respond. The people you get on the phone when you call their 800 number simply say it is \"Hawaii State Law\". I tried to explain to them that the Hawaii State Department of Agriculture told me directly that is not true. Although, you must go through a tremendous amount of red tape, the requirement to place the dogs in cargo coming into Hawaii is Hawaiian Airlines rule, not the state's. Alaska Airlines does allow small dogs to fly in the cabin with you coming into Hawaii.

I purchased a Noa pass which allows me 60 segments for the same price at anytime. I rarely know exactly when I fly and purchased the pass so I didn't have to deal w chance fees or hikes in last minute prices. I usually book my ticket 3 or 4 hrs prior to leaving. Flying w my dog is not a problem leaving honolulu. I usually call in to notify them I will be flying w her the moment I get my ticket. At the counter in honolulu, they follow procedure and do the checklist for my letter. I also make a copy for them so they don't have to go in the back to make a copy. They approve the letter, because I got it written exactly how they want it (that process is a whole other story) and they send me on my way. However, on Maui, they have consistently given me issues. They take my letter in the back and review it for over 20 mins leaving me w no one to talk to. They then say they need to review it w their supervisors and send the letter to someone up top. Honolulu does not to this, their staff are trained to process the letter. They are rude on maui. They tell me I need to not only call but also send in a copy of the letter 48 hrs in advance. This is not possible for people who travel frequently between islands and often book their flight only a fews hrs in advance. Further, sometimes I do not have access to a scanner or fax machine for the couple days I'm on maui. Everytime I'm on maui, the rude staff mention this woman Kristen Foster who apparently makes all these ridiculous rules and makes it a headache for people who travel w pets. I'm not sure why she is involved so much on maui, yet I never hear her name on oahu. I've heard other reviews where she has made life very difficult for people to fly w pets. Honest people, who are trying to follow the rules (which constantly chance) should not be treated this way. It is obvious that hawaiian airlines is trying to discourage people from flying w pets. Further, this ridiculous policy that they have come up w is not mandated by the federal government. I have flown on island air and they happily let my emmotional support dog on the plane w out any documentation and they also didn't even try to charge me. There is no one to talk to at hawaiian airlines about this issue. You are at the mercy of the staff at the check in desk. Even when u get your ducks in a row and follow their procedures, they come up w something else. This complaint is only directed at the staff at maui airport and this woman Kristen foster. Honolulu staff have been nothing but professional and kind. I hope hawaiian airlines looks into the rude behavior and irrational policies coming from the maui staff and Kristen foster. - ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg) Celia More than a year ago ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) Not accomodating Pet I was to travel Alaska originally which had electrical problems.

My poor dog was stuck in his kennel w/o bathroom from 4:45 AM LV time to 11:30 PM LV time when we arrived in Kahalui 8:30 PM. It just wasn't right.

This is why i am writing another review if it keeps anyone else from going what we went through its worth it. My dogs flight from Seattle to Hilo was 16 hours. When i got to Oahu i ended up with a 5 hour wait to go to Hilo I tried to bump my dog to a earlier flight and was told i could. Was told to get a big cart and bring him from agriculture to the counter, after looking for a half hour for the cart only to be told i was that i could not use them, went back to tIcket counter only to have a new employee there who told me i could not bump him up and wanted to know who told me that. I explained that the previous employee told me, she wanted to know the persons name ( i did not know) she then told she me she could not help me but called a supervisor and tha'ts when things went very downhill. I wanted her to try and reach cargo as they were closed on the weekend ( which it was ) she would not and told me my dog was not flying from Oahu to Hilo in baggage because no dogs do. At that time i told her i was booked to Hilo through cargo and she wanted proof, cargo does not give you inter Island paperwork till you arrive at cargo so i had nothing to show her for the second half of the flight to Hilo. I think at this point she thought I was lying as she became rude, and nasty. she told me if i thought my dog was flying cargo than i should go there. I asked her where cargo was and she said at cargo i then again asked her where cargo was and she again nastily said at cargo, i then where is cargo located and she raised her voice and said at cargo. As i was walking away a employee whispered to me its on Elliott st. I then spent then next hour trying find a place to stay for the weekend in Oahu ( since the supervisor told me my dog was not flying and it was the weekend and when you call cargo it said it was closed ) could not find any opening to stay that would take a dog. I then called my husband in Hilo in tears telling him that i was more than likely going to rent a van and spend the weekend in a parking lot with our dog till i could talk to someone at cargo on monday. I then called a taxi and the driver was incredible he could tell i was very distressed and i told him what was happening and he told me dogs fly out of cargo all the time to Hilo and that cargo was open for dogs going out. He also told me that if for some reason they were not open he would help me so i did not have to sleep in a rented van. He also took my dog to a dog park so he could get out of his kennel for a short time. He took me to cargo and they were expecting and waiting for my dog and yes my dog was flying in baggage to Hilo just like I told the supervisor at Hawaiian. I paid $816.00 for my dog to fly from Seattle to Hilo and were abused for that money. Saddest of all was that the Hawaiian supervisor could have reached cargo and it would have been cleared up instead she chose not to help me and on top of it treat me very rudely. I complained to Hawaiian airline and they came back and said it was a misunderstanding and gave me 1000 miles. No apology for the treatment i received from her. we no longer fly Hawaiian. We own property on the big island and now use Alaska Airlines and its only $100 dollars each direction for your pet to fly, it goes in baggage not cargo. They allow you to put you dog on right before the flight, no 3 hours early in cargo ( which is just plain cruel. A vet meets us in Kona and inspects our dogs paperwork and then we drive to Hilo. I do not think Hawaiian should be allowed to fly pets especially when they are unwilling to help you if there is a problem. More than anything i am glad our dog survived, he was so traumatized it was horrifying. i do not want anyone to go through what we went through.It was one of the most traumatizing thing I have been through. I take responsibilty for using Hawaiian cargo and learned a hard lesson from it never again. We even canceled our Hawaiian credit card. - ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg) Lila More than a year ago ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg) Very Pleased On our move to Hawai with our dogs, Hawaiian was very Helpful.

The service was good- uneventful (which is what you want). The dog arrived safely at the destination. The only issue is/was that Qatar Airways has bad info about the import requirements for Mozambique on their site. They list a Rabies Titer Test as required but it is not. This caused a lot of stress. We had the import permit in hand but was not sure they would let my dog through at check-in (they did). Years later, I'm still trying to get them to update the information on the website. But the service was inexpensive, straightforward, and courteous.

However, as I booked my travel through American, my flights were split with a codeshare - one with an AA flight # and another with a QR flight #, both operated by Qatar - because American does not fly to my destination. Despite repeated attempts (over 30 separate calls at least) to convince Qatar customer service that it was only possible to add my pets to my reservation through them (and not American as they did not operate the flight), I am at a loss to add my pets in advance and can only hope the agents at the counter can help me when I show up with my 2 dogs the day of travel. Additionally, the Qatar customer service helped me and added a support ticket for pet services for my initial travel date, but I had to push my travel date by about 2 months. When trying to explain and provide the reference # for the support ticket, I was still met with the same explanation that their system didn\u2019t allow them to take action (even though they did so earlier in April 2022 for my initial May 2022 travel). American also did not help, but I understood their position better as they do not own the plane and did not have the cargo/checked bagged specs for the plane. This has added a great deal of anxiety for myself and my wife as we attempt to move our family abroad. It\u2019s 2022 people, isn\u2019t there away to have this figured out by now? Cant i conference call both airlines? No, \u201cthat\u2019s not policy. You have to call them (American/Qatar) yourself.\u201d I\u2019m tired of getting sent on a wild goose chase, primarily by Qatar. Load More Reviews"

On both flights we were asked if there was anything we needed when he started getting vocal. They were very understanding and reassured me that it was just like travelling with a baby, they can be very unpredictable! (Shame some of the passengers didn't feel the same way). He did manage to chew his way out of his bag about half hour before landing at Malaga, much to my horror but everyone else's relief when the whining stopped!

Our oldest dog, Dick, is already a seaonsed traveller with 3 flights to Greece and Portugal under his belt :), and the younger one just completed his first flight to Portugal and back. Both travelled in the cabin in carrier bags, and were very well received by the crew. We were offered water for both, and were complimented on how well-behaved they were (both slept through all flights!).

Because it was still a very small dog, I took her in cabin. The one thing i would say though is the seats are very low and the small carrier i had did not fit. The height was the problem, not the width. This could have been a very big problem if the plane had been completely full. The staff was very understanding and it was an excellent experience. I will fly Lufthansa again with my dogs. Would put Lufthansa at the top of my list for flying with a dog. Load More Reviews"

He was too large for the cabin, so he had to be checked. I had to call to book his spot (I think you can now do this online). The check-in process was simple and they helped with any questions! We flew from Warsaw to Chicago and had no issues, they even gave him fresh water at some point!

The airline does not have a pet relief area at the Warsaw Airport but the dog can walk outside and once past the security he can just walk the airport.

We were warned this airline was awful, but they had the best flight option for our pup (would be direct and under 8 hours travel vs our other options were 2+ layovers totalling 23 hours travel), so in best interest of the dog we decided to give it a try. We called the airline prior to booking tickets, ran all the info by the call center and it all sounded good, our final destination was very strict on dog entry so we have all the vet paperwork in order, all rabies + additional vaccines, and we've researched to the bottom of the earth knowing what we need. W were told we had to book the flight first before booking him on a flight (which is common, and why we ran all the info by someone prior to paying for the flight). Once we booked the flight (non-refundable as all is during covid times) and proceeded to call back to book him on the flight, it was nothing but problems, \"NO sorry airline policy\", no assistance and we were even hung up on. After calling back 3 times we were given multiple excuses why we couldn't book him, all completely conflicting information between employees and supervisors, and even conflicting info from the supervisor directly. At one point the supervisor caved and said \"ok we can reserve him on the flight, you can pay the $250 usd, but you will still probably be denied boarding because we put notes on your file\". We asked how we could be sure, can we submit a vet health letter in advance, can we send you a picture so you can see he is not a brachiopatic (short nosed breathing issues - also if our dog had breathing issues why would we push to put him on a plane if he could die). We decided to go direct to the airport hoping to get better info than the call center idiots, the airport check in staff confirmed he was acceptable to fly / there is no issues why he couldn't, he told us to call them back and book as we wouldnt be turned away at check in. We called the call center back and still they refused, offering no solutions, finally we said we went to the aiport yesterday and they said it was fine, they said they cant belive us, so we went back to the airport again and asked the check in staff to write a note on our file, they did, they showed us the note and even gave us a line number to tell the call center staff. Sounds promising, we call the call center back and STILL DENIED, told there was no note, we suggested how the heck did we know it was on \"line 29\", she said well it only goes up to line 28 so no, we were told there was NO solution he would not be allowed on the flight, we would get not refund on the flights. After all this, we are out 4 days of our time, $1000 in flights, hundreds of dollars in gas and airport parking. We just gave up, after all this with no assurance he would get on, and the total lack of faith something else would go wrong and I value my dog more than $1,000 (oh we are moving, this wasn't for a vacation).

She was supposed to have a layover in Z\u00fcrich. The pilot decided to stop Geneva instead, so she missed her connection to Hamburg. There were no other flights, so they decided to put her up in a hotel with 20 franks. The problem was she was only allowed to take the one dog from the cabin. She was not allowed to get the other dog from cargo or luggage. We spent five hours on the phone to try to find our dog. We had no idea what was going on and where he was. It is not acceptable that she wasn\u2019t allowed to take the dog to the hotel. She had no choice. I don\u2019t know how they justify the liability and the well-being of our beloved family member. How much stress that would add to the journey. There was no explanation given, after several hours, we finally managed to talk to somebody who was apparently with the dog. Please, if you are traveling with a dog choose a different airline.

We called three times to confirm all the details were correct for our one small dog flying in cabin round trip (4 flights). I even had an email from Swiss confirming this. Regardless, when we got to the gate it said that we were booked to have our dog in check-in luggage. It\u2019s OK because they were able to correct it when we checked in. The staff on all of our flights were strict about keeping the dog in his carrier under the seat throughout the duration of the flight. But our little guy is quiet and chill, so it was easy to keep him hidden on a lap under the blanket when he wasn\u2019t in his carrier. The seats are very small and were very tight for the dog carrier and myself. Especially on the local Europe airplanes.

If you have a pet (cat or dog), DO NOT TRAVEL WITH AER LINGUS. Aer Lingus is NOT pet friendly. They claim to take pets only through cargo and also told me to book my ticket first and then book the pet later. My flight was for October, and when I called to book my pet, it took DAYS to hear back, at which point my 24 hour free cancellation window expired. When I finally heard back, they told me pet cargo is NOT done on the same plane as Aer Lingus and handled by a completely separate company, and told me the earliest they could take my cat was for November (a whole month later!) and NOT on the same flight I had booked. They also said my cat would have to fly out from Frankfurt when I was flying out of Berlin, and the price they quoted me was well over \u20ac1500. The pet will NOT be flying on the same plane as you, this is a lie and something they do NOT clarify on their website. Insane! I was so disgusted at this suggestion, to not only abandon my cat but take him to a whole separate city (or I could pay an extra \u20ac1000 for the cargo company to come pick him up, LOL) than where I was flying, I even told the guy on the phone \"Listen to yourself and the stupidity you are recommending me, would YOU do that to your pet?\" When I called Aer Lingus to complain, they refused to refund my ticket and said it wasn't their responsibility because they personally do not do pet cargo. Absolutely disgusting customer service, I escalated the call and spoke to multiple people and every single one of them was awful and unhelpful. Aer Lingus absolutely ruined my entire trip because they dropped this bomb on me less than a week before my trip. After Dublin I was supposed to return to Canada and had another flight to Toronto from Dublin, and had to also cancel that, losing another \u20ac800 itienary and the associated pet and bagagge fees. I was left scrambling for a last-minute solution that cost me \u20ac1600 with Lufthansa. I have been a frequent traveller for over a decade and this was by far my most horrible travelling experience in my entire life. I will never give Aer Lingus a cent and I am writing this review in hopes that anyone is considering ever using them for pet transportation finds this report, and does not go through the same experience I did. DO NOT USE AER LINGUS TO TRAVEL WITH ANIMALS. - [![Ann](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/841291/26169235_401921336917251_3960333_bzjJHQi.jpgoh8b7def32abe91b7d653fb0f7efa0f088oe5AB8246A?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\ \\\\ Ann\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/2940) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) Aer Lingus from Ireland to the US Absolutley the worst experience and we have not even gotten on the plane!

My dog did very well indeed with their coordinated care. If you plan to do this regularly, then it may help to get an Eu Pet Passport for him or her. It will require a repeat rabies vaccination given by the Eu veterinarian who issues the passport but the worming can be documented by a. US veterinarian within 5 days of Travel. It is very expensive though going from the US to Ireland about 1500 dollars plus 250 dollars. Listenhall fees. I think there are cheaper ways for the pet with an Eu passport. Such as flying to a country like France Italy, Switzerland on an airline that allows pets in cabin. However you have to get from that country to Ireland which means the pet has to be in cargo. Overall the passenger fees will be much more. I prefer the pet express route US to Dublin and cargo aer lingus Dublin to JFK. The staff are wonderful!!!!! Load More Reviews"

However, they gave me numbers to the cargo that all don't work - the NYC one is not existing and I called a NJ one myself they say it doesn't take personal flight booking and ask me to contact Singapore airline again, but Singapore airline ask me to contact them!

It's crazy! Hours of contact and nowhere can book cargo for my pet! Then I find out cargo and luggage are probably two things, so I asked customer support but they say only cargo?? But my cat is small and cargo is only for very big animals!! So are you saying cannot travel as luggage that you clearly indicated that you can travel with luggage on your official website?? Then the person changed his words and say it was wrong information you can carry the pet?? WTF?? I have not solved the problem but I will come back and follow up.

This past week, we had our first experience on Breeze and it was great! As with anything, read their policy carefully (https://www.flybreeze.com/support). Some of the bad experiences could have been avoided by doing that. The booking process is simple - you add and pay for your pet when you're making the reservation. This is not like Delta where you need to call/message after booking to add the pet, and then pay at the check-in counter. Since our pup was on the reservation and paid, we didn't have to do anything special when checking in. There wasn't even a tag that went on his carrier (Delta gives you a green \"Cabin Pet\") tag. At no point along the way were we stopped and asked about our dog. Truly a seamless process. We have the Away Pet Carrier which meets the posted dimensions for a cabin pet carrier. Nobody double checked measurements or weights. However, don't try to sneak a larger carrier on board. It will not fit under the seat. These are standard airline seats, a bigger carrier won't fit on this or any other airline. We booked the \"nicer\" seats with a little extra legroom close to the front of the plane (5A and 5C to be exact) which was nice because we could reach down and give him pets and snacks. I'd recommend doing the same. The Ascent seats in the front do not allow pets. So the \"nicer\" seats are the best you'll be able to do. The policy is that the carrier must be closed at all times. In our experience, nobody batted an eye at the front flap being open during flight so he could stretch out more (he's clipped into the carrier so he can't escape). This has been true on every flight we've taken, regardless of the airline. That said, the policy is the policy and they have every right to enforce it. The crew all said \"bye\" to him when we disembarked. Delta has never even acknowledged him. Overall, I'd highly recommend flying Breeze with your pet. The $75 each way is cheaper than most other domestic airlines too. - [![David](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/U0oUcPR4Go/DavidDean.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\ \\\\ David\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ Jun. 23, 2024](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1903646) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) Seriously?

Ingeneral a 25lb dog is close to this: Height (from ground to top of shoulder): 12 to 16 inches (30 to 40 cm) Length (from chest to base of tail): 18 to 24 inches (45 to 60 cm) Girth (around the widest part of the chest): 16 to 20 inches (40 to 50 cm) ... want you pet to be ok, fly elsewhere. - [![Corrinn](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/ZB1rY7yfw9/CorrinnDavis.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\ \\\\ Corrinn\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ Apr. 1, 2024](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1794438) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) Warning \u2013 be careful! I went to add my Yorkies to a flight I had booked on breeze. I\u2019ve traveled with my dogs many times on different airlines both in one carrier as they only weigh 17 pounds combined. Breeze only allows you one pet per carrier, regardless of whether combined pets and carrier weight is under 25 pounds. It was only AFTER I had booked my flight, Paid for the seat upgrade They require, and paid the pet fee that I learned that this airline does not allow multiple pets in one carrier. And of course they will not refund my flight fee, my pet fee, or my upgraded seat fee. They\u2019re the only airline I know that has this ridiculous policy - I guess it\u2019s just a way to get more money from unsuspecting passengers. Just a warning to check the fine print on anything you do with these people. I believe they are very duplicitous. - [![Nancy](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/bEcltekgsM/NancyAronson.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\ \\\\ Nancy\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1399574) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) Paid for great seats, they reassigned without any notice and won't give $50 back I booked to fly with Breeze and our dog Oliver. I paid for the great seats up front, $50 extra for the two of us. When we boarded the plane we noticed our seats were changed to the back of the plane and someone was sitting in our seats. I asked the steward on the plane and they said they were sorry and there was nothing they could do about it because the plane was full and to e-mail Breeze for a reimbursement. That was on May 20th. I have been e-mailing with Breeze back and forth and today they told me they changed my seats because of the pet and the carrier wouldn't fit under the seats I paid for. They offered me $35 in Breeze rewards, not the full $50 that I paid for. I do not understand why their site allowed me to purchase the seats in the first place since I booked with a pet and than instead of reimbursing me the full amount only offered me $35 in Breeze rewards, not a $50 credit to my account or $50 worth of breeze points. This was their error by allowing me to pay for the seats in the first place with the pet booking. So don't pay for the seats up front they reassign you without any notice and don't give back your $50 Load More Reviews"

We have moved internationally 12 times over the past 18 years--always with pets. I also work in rescue and regularly rehome pets in other countries. Point is, I've taken/sent pets on assorted airlines more times than I can count. And I can say without a doubt that Austrian and Lufthansa are BY FAR the best for pets. Not only do they have excellent customer service, they actually CARE about your animals. When we missed our connecting flight from Vienna to Bosnia (after flying from Washington DC), they IMMEDIATELY made sure that our dogs were fed, watered, and taken out for relief. They kept us apprised of the dogs' status, and moved mountains to get us on the next available flight. They even called the people who were meeting us in Bosnia to make sure they would be there to pick us up with the dogs. They really bent over backwards for us, to the point where I think the other passengers were wishing they'd brought pets too! Really, they are just extraordinary. And their rates for pet transport are very reasonable--especially when compared to the ridiculous prices (and shoddy service) of US airlines. One tip: if you're calling to book pets on your flight and have Skype, call their customer service center in Vienna. The service is much better than at the US number, and you'll get an answer faster. - ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg) Ashlyn More than a year ago ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg) Great Pet Travel!

We were moved (at no charge) to the bulk head row for more room for our pets. The flight was comfortable and the food was fine; we arrived to Vienna early as well.

They are not allowed in cargo. This totally makes sense since the issue is with breathing and traveling in the cabin eliminates that risk. It was a hassle to get the right agent on the line to add my Boston terrier to my flight. I think they were trying to add her as cargo so the system would not allow it. They only post breed restrictions for pets traveling in cargo. I told the customer service this and asked her to look up the rules for pets in cargo. She said the only restrictions are weight and carrier size. She then successfully added my little boston terrier to my flight! Load More Reviews"

Rudi is a 6kg Coton De Tulear. They weren't really interesting in the dog at check in, never checked his passport. Dogs need to fly in the seat next to the window, no idea why! But we did. Our bag fitted snuggly under the seat leangth wise (our soft bag was a little taller than their allowande of 21 cm (ours is 28cm). Barcelona airport has an amazing out door area that dogs can use - it is the smoking area localed near Macdonalds. There are plants that dogs can use for a quick pee, several dogs were there and we could run Rudi around. I'd fly Vueling with a dog again. Load More Reviews"

The crew members were friendly and let my nervous ESA dog alone and try not to disturb him. My dog slept on my lap during the entire flight, so I could not really move. They served my dinner on the next seat's table (the seat was empty) so I could eat some. I had a terrible experience flying with Southwest a day early, but Brussels Airlines staff were so helpful and knew how to deal with ESAs. No one was judgemental about having an ESA. I'll definitely fly with Brussels Airlines with my ESA again when I have to move to Europe for work. - ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg) Hannah More than a year ago ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg) Great I moved to Burundi in East Africa for work and I took my dog. I was very very nervous because it was the first time my dog was flying and it was a really long flight (two 9 hour flights with a 4 hour layover). Brussels Airlines was excellent, the airline attendants were very compassionate and accommodating and made sure to double check with ground staff to see if the dog was in the plane. And they made sure to tell me that they adjusted the temperature so that my dog was comfortable. Although, I was not supposed to see my dog in between flights, they gave me special permission to check on her. Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t take her out of the crate, but she seemed to be doing okay-just a bit nervous. On the way back, I had a similar experience. Overall, they were great and I would fly with then again. Load More Reviews"

I had flown on other carriers (1 regular, 1 low-cost, both European) 10 times last year with my dog. She is 6Kg and well under 8Kg including the transport bag. Last month I had to take Eurowings, checked allowed weight and dimensions were the same as those other 2 carriers - and at the airport they refused to check us in. They made a scene about the dog being too big (again, a 6Kg dog). The bag was also within the correct dimensions. All the while my dog was calmly lying in that same transport bag, proving she is well used to it and happy. That didn't matter to them - one of the employees was particularly nasty. I asked them to put it in writing and sign it. That required a supervisor. After a discussion I did not hear, they changed their minds and let us through. For a nasty 30 minutes at the check-in post, holding up a queue, I thought I would not be able to fly and was considering paying a fortune I can't spend, for a last-minute alternative involving 2 layovers. Never again with Eurowings. My dog and I don't need that kind of stress or risk. We've flown again with other carriers with the same weight limits since, no issues. - [![Jessica](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\ \\\\ Jessica\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ More than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1072678) ![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg) Strict My dog including his carrier was a little over 11kg.

Called beforehand to ask if there was availibility on the flights I wanted to book, booked flights, immediately phoned back and booking was accepted and confirmed a few minuted later.

They are the only mid- to large-size airline to my knowledge that allows pups up to 33 lbs. including carrier. SHAME on all other major airlines. Thank you so much, La Compagnie, for keeping families together. BTW, easy boarding, comfy lie-flat seats, good food and wine, nice flight attendants. Load More Reviews"
