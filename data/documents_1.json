You’ll find an overview of bringing Fido to many popular international destinations below. No matter where you’re going, you should contact the embassy or consulate of the destination country to confirm pet travel regulations, obtain all of the necessary paperwork (such as health certificates and documentation) regarding your pet’s travel, and contact your local veterinarian to ensure your pet is in compliance with foreign health regulations.\n\n\n\nFinally, don’t forget to check regulations on bringing Fido back to your home country too. Quarantine rules may apply even if your dog has only been gone a short time. Have more questions about crossing the pond with your pooch?

Pets are welcome to travel in the cabin and as checked baggage with Hawaiian Airlines.\n\n\n[Visit Website](https://www.hawaiianairlines.com/our-services/special-assistance/traveling-with-animals)\n\n\nOr call [(800) 367-5320](tel:+18003675320) for more information.\n\n\nYou can use BringFido to find a [pet friendly place to stay](https://www.bringfido.com/lodging/) at your destination.\n\n\n## Pets in the Cabin\n\nHawaiian Airlines welcomes small dogs and cats to fly in the passenger cabin on inter-island flights and flights between the State of Hawaii and the US Mainland, as long as the combined weight of the pet and carrier does not exceed 25 lbs (11 kg). Each passenger can travel with 1 carrier. Only 1 animal is permitted in each carrier, except for 2 puppies or kittens from the same litter or breed. There is a $35 fee for pets traveling in the passenger cabin on inter-island flights. For all other flights, the fee is $125 (each way). Pets are not accepted on international flights or flights to/from JFK, Boston or Austin.\n\n## Pets in Checked Baggage\n\nHawaiian Airlines welcomes dogs, cats, and household birds to be transported as checked baggage on inter-island flights and flights between the State of Hawaii and the US Mainland if the combined weight of the pet and carrier does not exceed 70 lbs (32 kg). The fee is $60 (each way) for inter-island flights and $225 (each way) for all other flights. Only 1 animal is permitted in each carrier, except for 2 puppies or kittens from the same litter or breed. In cases of extreme temperatures, Hawaiian Airlines reserves the right to restrict the transportation of your pet in cargo. Animals are not accepted as checked baggage from April 15 through October 15 from San Jose, CA; Sacramento, CA; Las Vegas, NV; and Phoenix, AZ.\n\n## Pets in Cargo\n\nIf the weight of your pet exceeds the weight limit permitted in the hold or Fido is traveling alone, you can transport them with Hawaiian Airlines Cargo Department. Contact them directly at 1-877-422-2746 for more information.\n\n## Carrier Guidelines\n\nFor pets traveling in the passenger cabin, carriers must be soft-sided, leak proof, and large enough to allow the animal to sit, stand upright, turn, and lay down in a natural position. They must not exceed the dimensions of 16\" x 10\" x 9.5\" (40 cm x 25 cm x 24 cm). The animal is required to stay in the carrier throughout the journey.

However, we had an absolutely AWFUL experience today. Apparently, Hawaiian Airlines had updated their policy to require that dogs flying in-cabin must be able to stand in an upright manner (their heads held at neutral, above-body height) while in their carrier. With a carrier height restriction of a measly 9.5\", this is impossible for most dogs. When we called to reserve a spot for our dogs, we were only told the usual (i.e. carrier and weight limitations, and that dogs must be able to comfortably turn around and lie in their carrier). When we tried to check in with an agent at the guest services counter, she immediately glared at us and told us that she won't allow our dog on the plane. She was completely unsympathetic, unfriendly, and unhelpful. Her only solution was to leave and come back with a hard-sided carrier to throw her in cargo. After debating for some time, we just left and ran into another agent who was able to assist us and was extremely apologetic. Furthermore, the first agent almost denied entry for our tiny 8 pound dog! I completely understand that dogs should not be stuffed into a carrier without any space to move, but their new policy is way too strict. Just be warned that you may be denied entry if you encounter the wrong guest agent!\n\n- [![Summer](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/ZrBJhx36l8/SummerDien.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nSummer\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1582956)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nHawaiian Airlines new pet carrier policy doesn’t make sense\n\n\n\nI flew from Maui OGG to Kauai LIH with my cat and she was taller than 9.5” (which is the max height for the soft sided pet carrier) and they were giving me a hard time because she couldn’t stand in her carrier. But not many cats can with that height restriction. I even had my friend bring a hard carrier for the cargo section but it was still too small. Their policy is obviously do not take into consideration the size of pets. Hawaiian Airlines was not very helpful And just shrugged and told me that rules are rules.

At the Services desk, where one needs to check in with a pet, I was immediately denied because the agent said my 12 pound dog could not comfortably stand in his soft-sided kennel. Mind you, this is a regulation-size soft sided kennel in which he travels to and from Boston on two 6-hr legs usually via Seattle on excellent Alaska Airlines. We make the round trip twice annually and use the very kennel in which he arrived to HNL on a Hawaiian flight 51 hours ago. Speaking of his fellow Kona-based HA agents he said “they were wrong” to allow me to depart Kona, that there were new rules implemented on June 1 and, other than presenting a printed sheet of paper showing Hawaiian’s new policy, was unwilling to assist me. Distressed and nearly furious, I awaited another agent who at least had the good sense to contact a supervisor. About 30 minutes later (!) a supervisor named Wendy approached, apologized for her delay, explained the policy and allowed me to check in. The new policy apparently does not allow a pet whose head would extend above the carrier when unzipped to travel in the cabin. So you might be able to travel with a 5 pound Chihuahua or heavier low-slung dog. If this BringFido site still shows the image of a small, bright-eyed white canine with its head extending through its soft-sided kennel then BEWARE of travel on Hawaiian with any pet similar in size. My little guy is smaller than that and we almost got stranded at HNL, trying only to return home on a 49 minute flight.\n\n- [![Susan](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/895002/asid481959382342968height50width50ext1557607594hashAeTPlxNUUaPpGfZn?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nSusan\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/177529)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nHassled every time in Oahu\n\n\n\nI have traveled many times with my Dogue De Bordeaux as a service dog and know all the rules and paperwork required....Hawaiian Airlines in Kona and Hilo and Seattle are wonderful...every time I have to go through Oahu even on inter’-island they are rude and try to tell me why my dog cannot go on the airplane....inter-island Oahu asked for my paperwork...the only thing they are allowed to ask me is does my dog provide a service and what that is...This time I got right in her face and all of a sudden my dog was allowed through without them needing anything...interesting. Once I came through Seattle to Oahu and on to Kona and here they go again at H.A. Oahu counter. This supervisor had me in tears trying to refuse me because my letter was on the doctor’s prescription pad instead of letterhead...wow, really? Seattle didn’t mind, no one else ever had a problem with it ever....This woman was horrible...another woman at the counter came up to me and said if I just wouldn’t have shown the letter, they would have allowed me through...Really??

We flew Shamu home via cargo and he was just fine!\n\n\n\nThe Humane Society was incredibly helpful in ensuring that we had all the correct paperwork for Shamu - but made one small mistake on his medical sheet. It wasn't a huge problem they quickly drew us up a new one and we ran over to get it (Only a few miles away).\n\n\n\nIf you make sure you get to your flight early and you have the proper paperwork easy peasy!\n\n\n\nI attached a nice little letter introducing himself to the airline staff and a little bag of candy for them as well.

I flew 3 different carriers with my pet and Hawaiian, the 4th carrier gave me the MOST problems. I checked in 3 hours before my flight from San Diego to Honolulu and they made me wait 2 hours while they went to process authorization. They then said they would make an exception and let me fly. I should have made them not make the exception as the Federal complaint was excused because the airline did allow me to fly. Big deal, they just got away with discrimination and will continue to do this over and over again. I guess they truly don't want to accept pets and if so, them they should just NOT do it.\n\n\n\nAlso, it is NOT Hawaii Quarrantine that doesn't allow the pets in the cabin as many are told. It is the AIRLINES who are refusing to allow the pets in cabin into Hawaii. Kudos to ALASKA AIR.

I tried to explain to them that the Hawaii State Department of Agriculture told me directly that is not true. Although, you must go through a tremendous amount of red tape, the requirement to place the dogs in cargo coming into Hawaii is Hawaiian Airlines rule, not the state's.

I purchased a Noa pass which allows me 60 segments for the same price at anytime. I rarely know exactly when I fly and purchased the pass so I didn't have to deal w chance fees or hikes in last minute prices. I usually book my ticket 3 or 4 hrs prior to leaving.\n\nFlying w my dog is not a problem leaving honolulu. I usually call in to notify them I will be flying w her the moment I get my ticket. At the counter in honolulu, they follow procedure and do the checklist for my letter. I also make a copy for them so they don't have to go in the back to make a copy. They approve the letter, because I got it written exactly how they want it (that process is a whole other story) and they send me on my way.\n\nHowever, on Maui, they have consistently given me issues. They take my letter in the back and review it for over 20 mins leaving me w no one to talk to. They then say they need to review it w their supervisors and send the letter to someone up top. Honolulu does not to this, their staff are trained to process the letter. They are rude on maui. They tell me I need to not only call but also send in a copy of the letter 48 hrs in advance. This is not possible for people who travel frequently between islands and often book their flight only a fews hrs in advance. Further, sometimes I do not have access to a scanner or fax machine for the couple days I'm on maui. Everytime I'm on maui, the rude staff mention this woman Kristen Foster who apparently makes all these ridiculous rules and makes it a headache for people who travel w pets. I'm not sure why she is involved so much on maui, yet I never hear her name on oahu. I've heard other reviews where she has made life very difficult for people to fly w pets. Honest people, who are trying to follow the rules (which constantly chance) should not be treated this way. It is obvious that hawaiian airlines is trying to discourage people from flying w pets. Further, this ridiculous policy that they have come up w is not mandated by the federal government. I have flown on island air and they happily let my emmotional support dog on the plane w out any documentation and they also didn't even try to charge me. There is no one to talk to at hawaiian airlines about this issue. You are at the mercy of the staff at the check in desk. Even when u get your ducks in a row and follow their procedures, they come up w something else. This complaint is only directed at the staff at maui airport and this woman Kristen foster. Honolulu staff have been nothing but professional and kind. I hope hawaiian airlines looks into the rude behavior and irrational policies coming from the maui staff and Kristen foster.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nCelia\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nNot accomodating Pet\n\n\n\nI was to travel Alaska originally which had electrical problems.

This is why i am writing another review if it keeps anyone else from going what we went through its worth it. My dogs flight from Seattle to Hilo was 16 hours. When i got to Oahu i ended up with a 5 hour wait to go to Hilo I tried to bump my dog to a earlier flight and was told i could. Was told to get a big cart and bring him from agriculture to the counter, after looking for a half hour for the cart only to be told i was that i could not use them, went back to tIcket counter only to have a new employee there who told me i could not bump him up and wanted to know who told me that. I explained that the previous employee told me, she wanted to know the persons name ( i did not know) she then told she me she could not help me but called a supervisor and tha'ts when things went very downhill. I wanted her to try and reach cargo as they were closed on the weekend ( which it was ) she would not and told me my dog was not flying from Oahu to Hilo in baggage because no dogs do. At that time i told her i was booked to Hilo through cargo and she wanted proof, cargo does not give you inter Island paperwork till you arrive at cargo so i had nothing to show her for the second half of the flight to Hilo. I think at this point she thought I was lying as she became rude, and nasty. she told me if i thought my dog was flying cargo than i should go there. I asked her where cargo was and she said at cargo i then again asked her where cargo was and she again nastily said at cargo, i then where is cargo located and she raised her voice and said at cargo. As i was walking away a employee whispered to me its on Elliott st. I then spent then next hour trying find a place to stay for the weekend in Oahu ( since the supervisor told me my dog was not flying and it was the weekend and when you call cargo it said it was closed ) could not find any opening to stay that would take a dog. I then called my husband in Hilo in tears telling him that i was more than likely going to rent a van and spend the weekend in a parking lot with our dog till i could talk to someone at cargo on monday. I then called a taxi and the driver was incredible he could tell i was very distressed and i told him what was happening and he told me dogs fly out of cargo all the time to Hilo and that cargo was open for dogs going out. He also told me that if for some reason they were not open he would help me so i did not have to sleep in a rented van. He also took my dog to a dog park so he could get out of his kennel for a short time. He took me to cargo and they were expecting and waiting for my dog and yes my dog was flying in baggage to Hilo just like I told the supervisor at Hawaiian. I paid $816.00 for my dog to fly from Seattle to Hilo and were abused for that money. Saddest of all was that the Hawaiian supervisor could have reached cargo and it would have been cleared up instead she chose not to help me and on top of it treat me very rudely. I complained to Hawaiian airline and they came back and said it was a misunderstanding and gave me 1000 miles. No apology for the treatment i received from her. we no longer fly Hawaiian. We own property on the big island and now use Alaska Airlines and its only $100 dollars each direction for your pet to fly, it goes in baggage not cargo. They allow you to put you dog on right before the flight, no 3 hours early in cargo ( which is just plain cruel. A vet meets us in Kona and inspects our dogs paperwork and then we drive to Hilo. I do not think Hawaiian should be allowed to fly pets especially when they are unwilling to help you if there is a problem. More than anything i am glad our dog survived, he was so traumatized it was horrifying. i do not want anyone to go through what we went through.It was one of the most traumatizing thing I have been through. I take responsibilty for using Hawaiian cargo and learned a hard lesson from it never again. We even canceled our Hawaiian credit card.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nLila\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nVery Pleased\n\n\n\nOn our move to Hawai with our dogs, Hawaiian was very Helpful. When we boarded we told the flight attendant that we had 2 dogs in cargo. He went to check that they were boarded, then went to check himself. They were under the pilots where the fresh air comes in and they kept the light on for them. When we got them from the animal office -they were ready for release as soon as we landed, got our bags and got to the office. They were very helpful in making our and our dogs flights very comfortable.\n\n\nLoad More Reviews\n\nLoading…\n\nFailed.\n[Post a Review](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/15/review/)![Bubble](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bubble.svg)\n\nPost a Review\n\n\n## Traveler Photos\n\n\nWe haven‘t received any photos of dogs flying Hawaiian Airlines yet.\n\n\n\n\nWant to feature your creature?

Pets are welcome to travel in the cabin and as checked baggage in the hold with KLM.\n\n\n[Visit Website](https://www.klm.com/travel/us_en/prepare_for_travel/travel_planning/pets/index.htm)\n\n\nOr call [(866) 434-0320](tel:+18664340320) for more information.\n\n\nYou can use BringFido to find a [pet friendly place to stay](https://www.bringfido.com/lodging/) at your destination.\n\n\n## Pets in the Cabin\n\nKLM welcomes small cats and dogs into the economy cabin on most of their flights, and in business class on flights within Europe. Dogs are welcome in the cabin if the combined weight of the pet and carrier is under 18 lbs (8 kg). Each passenger is permitted to travel with 1 pet. To bring your cat or dog with you, you’ll pay a fee of EUR 75 to EUR 400 per one-way.\n\n## Pets in Checked Baggage\n\nPets and carriers weighing more than 18 lbs (8 kg) can be transported in the hold with KLM. To travel as checked baggage in the hold, pets and carriers can weigh a maximum 165 lbs (75 kg). Passengers can check up to 3 pets in the hold. If you have a transfer time of more than 3 hours, or your flight is operated with a Boeing 787-9 or 787-10 aircraft, then you are not allowed to travel with a pet in the hold. To bring your cat or dog with you, you’ll pay a fee of EUR 75 to EUR 400 per one-way.\n\n## Pets in Cargo\n\nPets that exceed the maximum weight for traveling in the hold, those traveling alone, or animals that are heading to countries where they require pets to be transported as freight, can all go through Air France-KLM Cargo instead, where animals are shipped with a special cargo agent. Pets and carriers weighing more than 165 lbs (75 kg) or exceeding 115\" (292 cm) in height must travel this way. On some types of aircraft, the kennel must not be larger than 97\" (247 cm). You can contact them directly at 800-556-9000 to find out prices, availability, and conditions for your pet's travel plans.\n\n## Carrier Guidelines\n\nFor animals traveling in the cabin, carriers must be soft-sided and no bigger than 18\" x 11\" x 9\" (46 cm x 28 cm x 24 cm). Pets must be able to stand up and lay down comfortably inside. For pets traveling in the hold, carriers must not exceed the dimensions of 48\" x 32\" x 35\" (122 cm x 81 cm x 89 cm) on KLM flights and 40\" x 27\" x 30\" (102 cm x 69 cm x 76 cm) on KLM Cityhopper flights. Carriers must alsohave a fiberglass or rigid plastic shell, wheels must be removed or blocked with duct tape, the door must have a centralized locking system, and the two parts of the carrier must be joined by bolts. It must be large enough for your pet to stand up without touching the top, turn around easily, and lie down in a natural position.\n\n## Other Restrictions\n\nUnfortunately, snub-nosed breeds are not allowed to travel with KLM. Animals of this type must be transported via KLM Cargo. The following dog breeds are not accepted for travel with KLM: Affenpinscher, American Bully, Boston Terrier, Boxers (all breeds), Bulldogs (all breeds), Bull Mastiff, Cane Corso, Pugs (all breeds), Chow-Chow, Great Dane (all breeds), Certain breeds of Spaniel (Tibetan, Japanese, English, King Charles), Brussels Griffon, Lhasa Apso, Mastiffs (all breeds), Neapolitan Mastiff, Pekingese, Small Brabant, Shih Tzu, Shar Pei, Staffordshire Bull Terrier.

In Amsterdam this airline has a special dog hotel stop where they feed and water the dog, they let the dog out for potty and even clean the cage if necessary. On both flights the very nice staff reassurede that my dog was indeed on board and that the pressure and the temperature is fine for my dog in the luggage department in the belly of the plane. When I arrived to Mexico I was surprised to see that the kennel of my dog was replaced by a bigger one, to make her feel more comfortable. I am so so so pleased with their services and their sensitivity to people who fly with dogs!

You’ll find an overview of bringing Fido to many popular international destinations below. No matter where you’re going, you should contact the embassy or consulate of the destination country to confirm pet travel regulations, obtain all of the necessary paperwork (such as health certificates and documentation) regarding your pet’s travel, and contact your local veterinarian to ensure your pet is in compliance with foreign health regulations.\n\n\n\nFinally, don’t forget to check regulations on bringing Fido back to your home country too. Quarantine rules may apply even if your dog has only been gone a short time. Have more questions about crossing the pond with your pooch?

However, we had an absolutely AWFUL experience today. Apparently, Hawaiian Airlines had updated their policy to require that dogs flying in-cabin must be able to stand in an upright manner (their heads held at neutral, above-body height) while in their carrier. With a carrier height restriction of a measly 9.5\", this is impossible for most dogs. When we called to reserve a spot for our dogs, we were only told the usual (i.e. carrier and weight limitations, and that dogs must be able to comfortably turn around and lie in their carrier). When we tried to check in with an agent at the guest services counter, she immediately glared at us and told us that she won't allow our dog on the plane. She was completely unsympathetic, unfriendly, and unhelpful. Her only solution was to leave and come back with a hard-sided carrier to throw her in cargo. After debating for some time, we just left and ran into another agent who was able to assist us and was extremely apologetic. Furthermore, the first agent almost denied entry for our tiny 8 pound dog! I completely understand that dogs should not be stuffed into a carrier without any space to move, but their new policy is way too strict. Just be warned that you may be denied entry if you encounter the wrong guest agent!\n\n- [![Summer](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/ZrBJhx36l8/SummerDien.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nSummer\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1582956)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nHawaiian Airlines new pet carrier policy doesn’t make sense\n\n\n\nI flew from Maui OGG to Kauai LIH with my cat and she was taller than 9.5” (which is the max height for the soft sided pet carrier) and they were giving me a hard time because she couldn’t stand in her carrier. But not many cats can with that height restriction. I even had my friend bring a hard carrier for the cargo section but it was still too small. Their policy is obviously do not take into consideration the size of pets. Hawaiian Airlines was not very helpful And just shrugged and told me that rules are rules. But they let me go with the exception that when I fly back to Maui that I would get a new carrier for her.\n\n- [![Betty](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nBetty\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1468081)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nNew requirements are impossible\n\n\n\nThe max size carrier of 16\" x 10\" x 9.5\" are impossible, because I cannot find a carrier that isn't at least 17\"! Before this was never a problem, but now with the new requirements I almost got turned away when taking my cat to the vet the other day. The gate agent at Kona was very curt, brought out a tape measure, told me I couldn't bring her in the cabin! I eventually was let onto the plane, but not until after a lot of back-and-forth.

Heartless, cold, hating life and definitely hating their jobs. Can’t even look at you when communicating. If you don’t play along with their mood they will complicate things for you. Luckily my wife is skilled at working with entitled people as a hotel front desk agent. She was able to stroke the lady’s egos just enough to get our dogs processed in time. We almost missed our connecting flight to Maui from California because the quarantine employees seemed to have some office drama going on between them. My advice: if going to an outer island be sure to use the direct release program.\n\n- [![Sid](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/F5oCMBZOdC/SidKarpav.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nSid\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1420249)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nBEWARE of new HA in-cabin policy…\n\n\n\nAm at Honolulu (HNL) awaiting return to Kona (KOA), from where we left two days ago. At the Services desk, where one needs to check in with a pet, I was immediately denied because the agent said my 12 pound dog could not comfortably stand in his soft-sided kennel. Mind you, this is a regulation-size soft sided kennel in which he travels to and from Boston on two 6-hr legs usually via Seattle on excellent Alaska Airlines. We make the round trip twice annually and use the very kennel in which he arrived to HNL on a Hawaiian flight 51 hours ago. Speaking of his fellow Kona-based HA agents he said “they were wrong” to allow me to depart Kona, that there were new rules implemented on June 1 and, other than presenting a printed sheet of paper showing Hawaiian’s new policy, was unwilling to assist me. Distressed and nearly furious, I awaited another agent who at least had the good sense to contact a supervisor. About 30 minutes later (!) a supervisor named Wendy approached, apologized for her delay, explained the policy and allowed me to check in. The new policy apparently does not allow a pet whose head would extend above the carrier when unzipped to travel in the cabin. So you might be able to travel with a 5 pound Chihuahua or heavier low-slung dog. If this BringFido site still shows the image of a small, bright-eyed white canine with its head extending through its soft-sided kennel then BEWARE of travel on Hawaiian with any pet similar in size. My little guy is smaller than that and we almost got stranded at HNL, trying only to return home on a 49 minute flight.\n\n- [![Susan](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/895002/asid481959382342968height50width50ext1557607594hashAeTPlxNUUaPpGfZn?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nSusan\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/177529)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nHassled every time in Oahu\n\n\n\nI have traveled many times with my Dogue De Bordeaux as a service dog and know all the rules and paperwork required....Hawaiian Airlines in Kona and Hilo and Seattle are wonderful...every time I have to go through Oahu even on inter’-island they are rude and try to tell me why my dog cannot go on the airplane....inter-island Oahu asked for my paperwork...the only thing they are allowed to ask me is does my dog provide a service and what that is...This time I got right in her face and all of a sudden my dog was allowed through without them needing anything...interesting. Once I came through Seattle to Oahu and on to Kona and here they go again at H.A. Oahu counter. This supervisor had me in tears trying to refuse me because my letter was on the doctor’s prescription pad instead of letterhead...wow, really? Seattle didn’t mind, no one else ever had a problem with it ever....This woman was horrible...another woman at the counter came up to me and said if I just wouldn’t have shown the letter, they would have allowed me through...Really?? Incredible...\n\nI love flying Hawaiian Airlines and will continue to do so now that I know their game in Oahu\n\n- [![Derek](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nDerek\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/105509)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nGreat expirence\n\n\n\nWhile vacationing on Kauai last February we adopted \"Shamu\" our 4 year old black lab... Little did we know when adopting him that nobody would fly him back to Massachusetts for us.... except Hawaiian. We flew Shamu home via cargo and he was just fine!\n\n\n\nThe Humane Society was incredibly helpful in ensuring that we had all the correct paperwork for Shamu - but made one small mistake on his medical sheet. It wasn't a huge problem they quickly drew us up a new one and we ran over to get it (Only a few miles away).\n\n\n\nIf you make sure you get to your flight early and you have the proper paperwork easy peasy!\n\n\n\nI attached a nice little letter introducing himself to the airline staff and a little bag of candy for them as well. They treated our boy with much aloha and he had a great flight home.\n\n\n\nThe only caution I will give is if you are flying your dog into a cold climate... BEWARE! You MUST watch the weather reports like a hawk or your dog may not fly.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nHikari\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nNot Pet Friendly\n\n\n\nFiled a federal complaint against Hawaiian. I flew 3 different carriers with my pet and Hawaiian, the 4th carrier gave me the MOST problems. I checked in 3 hours before my flight from San Diego to Honolulu and they made me wait 2 hours while they went to process authorization. They then said they would make an exception and let me fly. I should have made them not make the exception as the Federal complaint was excused because the airline did allow me to fly. Big deal, they just got away with discrimination and will continue to do this over and over again. I guess they truly don't want to accept pets and if so, them they should just NOT do it.\n\n\n\nAlso, it is NOT Hawaii Quarrantine that doesn't allow the pets in the cabin as many are told. It is the AIRLINES who are refusing to allow the pets in cabin into Hawaii. Kudos to ALASKA AIR.

I have tried very hard to speak with their public relations/customer service people at corporate to try to change this, but they absolutely will not respond. The people you get on the phone when you call their 800 number simply say it is \"Hawaii State Law\". I tried to explain to them that the Hawaii State Department of Agriculture told me directly that is not true. Although, you must go through a tremendous amount of red tape, the requirement to place the dogs in cargo coming into Hawaii is Hawaiian Airlines rule, not the state's. Alaska Airlines does allow small dogs to fly in the cabin with you coming into Hawaii.

I purchased a Noa pass which allows me 60 segments for the same price at anytime. I rarely know exactly when I fly and purchased the pass so I didn't have to deal w chance fees or hikes in last minute prices. I usually book my ticket 3 or 4 hrs prior to leaving.\n\nFlying w my dog is not a problem leaving honolulu. I usually call in to notify them I will be flying w her the moment I get my ticket. At the counter in honolulu, they follow procedure and do the checklist for my letter. I also make a copy for them so they don't have to go in the back to make a copy. They approve the letter, because I got it written exactly how they want it (that process is a whole other story) and they send me on my way.\n\nHowever, on Maui, they have consistently given me issues. They take my letter in the back and review it for over 20 mins leaving me w no one to talk to. They then say they need to review it w their supervisors and send the letter to someone up top. Honolulu does not to this, their staff are trained to process the letter. They are rude on maui. They tell me I need to not only call but also send in a copy of the letter 48 hrs in advance. This is not possible for people who travel frequently between islands and often book their flight only a fews hrs in advance. Further, sometimes I do not have access to a scanner or fax machine for the couple days I'm on maui. Everytime I'm on maui, the rude staff mention this woman Kristen Foster who apparently makes all these ridiculous rules and makes it a headache for people who travel w pets. I'm not sure why she is involved so much on maui, yet I never hear her name on oahu. I've heard other reviews where she has made life very difficult for people to fly w pets. Honest people, who are trying to follow the rules (which constantly chance) should not be treated this way. It is obvious that hawaiian airlines is trying to discourage people from flying w pets. Further, this ridiculous policy that they have come up w is not mandated by the federal government. I have flown on island air and they happily let my emmotional support dog on the plane w out any documentation and they also didn't even try to charge me. There is no one to talk to at hawaiian airlines about this issue. You are at the mercy of the staff at the check in desk. Even when u get your ducks in a row and follow their procedures, they come up w something else. This complaint is only directed at the staff at maui airport and this woman Kristen foster. Honolulu staff have been nothing but professional and kind. I hope hawaiian airlines looks into the rude behavior and irrational policies coming from the maui staff and Kristen foster.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nCelia\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nNot accomodating Pet\n\n\n\nI was to travel Alaska originally which had electrical problems.

I'm not impressed now that I read there policy and it states he could have flown with a $175 charge. Instead I ran back to Alaska which was great in the end. My poor dog was stuck in his kennel w/o bathroom from 4:45 AM LV time to 11:30 PM LV time when we arrived in Kahalui 8:30 PM. It just wasn't right.\n\nI showed all my paperwork for the 5 day or direct release program which should have sufficed.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nmike richards\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nHappy, happy ,happy\n\n\n\nI found the Hawaiian Airlines employees to be very friendly and helpful , I shipped my 106 lb. bull mastiff thru their cargo dept. from Seattle to Honolulu.

This is why i am writing another review if it keeps anyone else from going what we went through its worth it. My dogs flight from Seattle to Hilo was 16 hours. When i got to Oahu i ended up with a 5 hour wait to go to Hilo I tried to bump my dog to a earlier flight and was told i could. Was told to get a big cart and bring him from agriculture to the counter, after looking for a half hour for the cart only to be told i was that i could not use them, went back to tIcket counter only to have a new employee there who told me i could not bump him up and wanted to know who told me that. I explained that the previous employee told me, she wanted to know the persons name ( i did not know) she then told she me she could not help me but called a supervisor and tha'ts when things went very downhill. I wanted her to try and reach cargo as they were closed on the weekend ( which it was ) she would not and told me my dog was not flying from Oahu to Hilo in baggage because no dogs do. At that time i told her i was booked to Hilo through cargo and she wanted proof, cargo does not give you inter Island paperwork till you arrive at cargo so i had nothing to show her for the second half of the flight to Hilo. I think at this point she thought I was lying as she became rude, and nasty. she told me if i thought my dog was flying cargo than i should go there. I asked her where cargo was and she said at cargo i then again asked her where cargo was and she again nastily said at cargo, i then where is cargo located and she raised her voice and said at cargo. As i was walking away a employee whispered to me its on Elliott st. I then spent then next hour trying find a place to stay for the weekend in Oahu ( since the supervisor told me my dog was not flying and it was the weekend and when you call cargo it said it was closed ) could not find any opening to stay that would take a dog. I then called my husband in Hilo in tears telling him that i was more than likely going to rent a van and spend the weekend in a parking lot with our dog till i could talk to someone at cargo on monday. I then called a taxi and the driver was incredible he could tell i was very distressed and i told him what was happening and he told me dogs fly out of cargo all the time to Hilo and that cargo was open for dogs going out. He also told me that if for some reason they were not open he would help me so i did not have to sleep in a rented van. He also took my dog to a dog park so he could get out of his kennel for a short time. He took me to cargo and they were expecting and waiting for my dog and yes my dog was flying in baggage to Hilo just like I told the supervisor at Hawaiian. I paid $816.00 for my dog to fly from Seattle to Hilo and were abused for that money. Saddest of all was that the Hawaiian supervisor could have reached cargo and it would have been cleared up instead she chose not to help me and on top of it treat me very rudely. I complained to Hawaiian airline and they came back and said it was a misunderstanding and gave me 1000 miles. No apology for the treatment i received from her. we no longer fly Hawaiian. We own property on the big island and now use Alaska Airlines and its only $100 dollars each direction for your pet to fly, it goes in baggage not cargo. They allow you to put you dog on right before the flight, no 3 hours early in cargo ( which is just plain cruel. A vet meets us in Kona and inspects our dogs paperwork and then we drive to Hilo. I do not think Hawaiian should be allowed to fly pets especially when they are unwilling to help you if there is a problem. More than anything i am glad our dog survived, he was so traumatized it was horrifying. i do not want anyone to go through what we went through.It was one of the most traumatizing thing I have been through. I take responsibilty for using Hawaiian cargo and learned a hard lesson from it never again. We even canceled our Hawaiian credit card.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nLila\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nVery Pleased\n\n\n\nOn our move to Hawai with our dogs, Hawaiian was very Helpful. When we boarded we told the flight attendant that we had 2 dogs in cargo. He went to check that they were boarded, then went to check himself. They were under the pilots where the fresh air comes in and they kept the light on for them. When we got them from the animal office -they were ready for release as soon as we landed, got our bags and got to the office. They were very helpful in making our and our dogs flights very comfortable.\n\n\nLoad More Reviews\n\nLoading…\n\nFailed.\n[Post a Review](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/15/review/)![Bubble](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bubble.svg)\n\nPost a Review\n\n\n## Traveler Photos\n\n\nWe haven‘t received any photos of dogs flying Hawaiian Airlines yet.\n\n\n\n\nWant to feature your creature?

You’ll find an overview of bringing Fido to many popular international destinations below. No matter where you’re going, you should contact the embassy or consulate of the destination country to confirm pet travel regulations, obtain all of the necessary paperwork (such as health certificates and documentation) regarding your pet’s travel, and contact your local veterinarian to ensure your pet is in compliance with foreign health regulations.\n\n\n\nFinally, don’t forget to check regulations on bringing Fido back to your home country too. Quarantine rules may apply even if your dog has only been gone a short time. Have more questions about crossing the pond with your pooch?

Pets are welcome to travel in the cabin and as checked baggage in the hold with KLM.\n\n\n[Visit Website](https://www.klm.com/travel/us_en/prepare_for_travel/travel_planning/pets/index.htm)\n\n\nOr call [(866) 434-0320](tel:+18664340320) for more information.\n\n\nYou can use BringFido to find a [pet friendly place to stay](https://www.bringfido.com/lodging/) at your destination.\n\n\n## Pets in the Cabin\n\nKLM welcomes small cats and dogs into the economy cabin on most of their flights, and in business class on flights within Europe. Dogs are welcome in the cabin if the combined weight of the pet and carrier is under 18 lbs (8 kg). Each passenger is permitted to travel with 1 pet. To bring your cat or dog with you, you’ll pay a fee of EUR 75 to EUR 400 per one-way.\n\n## Pets in Checked Baggage\n\nPets and carriers weighing more than 18 lbs (8 kg) can be transported in the hold with KLM. To travel as checked baggage in the hold, pets and carriers can weigh a maximum 165 lbs (75 kg). Passengers can check up to 3 pets in the hold. If you have a transfer time of more than 3 hours, or your flight is operated with a Boeing 787-9 or 787-10 aircraft, then you are not allowed to travel with a pet in the hold. To bring your cat or dog with you, you’ll pay a fee of EUR 75 to EUR 400 per one-way.\n\n## Pets in Cargo\n\nPets that exceed the maximum weight for traveling in the hold, those traveling alone, or animals that are heading to countries where they require pets to be transported as freight, can all go through Air France-KLM Cargo instead, where animals are shipped with a special cargo agent. Pets and carriers weighing more than 165 lbs (75 kg) or exceeding 115\" (292 cm) in height must travel this way. On some types of aircraft, the kennel must not be larger than 97\" (247 cm). You can contact them directly at 800-556-9000 to find out prices, availability, and conditions for your pet's travel plans.\n\n## Carrier Guidelines\n\nFor animals traveling in the cabin, carriers must be soft-sided and no bigger than 18\" x 11\" x 9\" (46 cm x 28 cm x 24 cm). Pets must be able to stand up and lay down comfortably inside. For pets traveling in the hold, carriers must not exceed the dimensions of 48\" x 32\" x 35\" (122 cm x 81 cm x 89 cm) on KLM flights and 40\" x 27\" x 30\" (102 cm x 69 cm x 76 cm) on KLM Cityhopper flights. Carriers must alsohave a fiberglass or rigid plastic shell, wheels must be removed or blocked with duct tape, the door must have a centralized locking system, and the two parts of the carrier must be joined by bolts. It must be large enough for your pet to stand up without touching the top, turn around easily, and lie down in a natural position.\n\n## Other Restrictions\n\nUnfortunately, snub-nosed breeds are not allowed to travel with KLM. Animals of this type must be transported via KLM Cargo. The following dog breeds are not accepted for travel with KLM: Affenpinscher, American Bully, Boston Terrier, Boxers (all breeds), Bulldogs (all breeds), Bull Mastiff, Cane Corso, Pugs (all breeds), Chow-Chow, Great Dane (all breeds), Certain breeds of Spaniel (Tibetan, Japanese, English, King Charles), Brussels Griffon, Lhasa Apso, Mastiffs (all breeds), Neapolitan Mastiff, Pekingese, Small Brabant, Shih Tzu, Shar Pei, Staffordshire Bull Terrier. The following cat breeds are not permitted: Burmese, Exotic Shorthair, Himalayan, and Persian.\n\n## Reviews\n\nBringFido Guest Rating\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKLM Royal Dutch Airlines has received a rating of 4.0 out of 5 bones by 0 canine critics on BringFido.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/loading.svg)\n\nLoading reviews…\n\nUnable to load.\n\n\n- [![Nele](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/URwVloSPcR/asid10200541726205621height50width50ext1636386933hashAeT8IvGRdaILBIYeRpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nNele\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/847841)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nGreat experience, kind staff\n\n\n\nI flew with my cat in the cabin from Netherlands to Spain.

In Amsterdam this airline has a special dog hotel stop where they feed and water the dog, they let the dog out for potty and even clean the cage if necessary. On both flights the very nice staff reassurede that my dog was indeed on board and that the pressure and the temperature is fine for my dog in the luggage department in the belly of the plane. When I arrived to Mexico I was surprised to see that the kennel of my dog was replaced by a bigger one, to make her feel more comfortable. I am so so so pleased with their services and their sensitivity to people who fly with dogs! Thank you so much KLM!\n\n- [![Abhishek](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nAbhishek\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/153839)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nPleasant experience\n\n\n\nI flew with my 10 week old pup from Prague to San Francisco through a 3.5 hr layover at Amsterdam while whole journey took about 16 hrs due to a delay resulting from a technical issue. The flight attendants were cordial with the pet. I lucked with a pet loving traveller in my row and an empty seat beside me on my first leg and the flight crew moved me to a similar setting on the second leg of the journey after finding the person in my initial assigned row had allergies. All in all a positive experience\n\n\nLoad More Reviews\n\nLoading…\n\nFailed.\n[Post a Review](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/38/review/)![Bubble](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bubble.svg)\n\nPost a Review\n\n\n## Traveler Photos\n\n\nWe haven‘t received any photos of dogs flying KLM Royal Dutch Airlines yet.\n\n\n\n\nWant to feature your creature?

    "markdown": "# Airline Pet Policies\n\nPlanning to fly with your dog? While air travel can be a quick way to get Fido from one place to another, you should know that every airline has different rules about transporting pets. Some allow small dogs to travel in the aircraft cabin as part of your carry-on luggage allowance, while others will only allow pets to travel in the cargo area, and fees can vary from nothing at all to more than $500. Also, most airlines only allow one or two dogs on each flight, so always make sure a “seat” is available for your dog BEFORE buying your own ticket.\n\n\nTo take off without a hitch, please read our [Ten Tips for Flying with Fido](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/top_10_tips/), and familiarize yourself with current [U.S. Travel Regulations](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/us_regulations/) or [International Pet Travel](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/international/) restrictions before you go.

    "markdown": "# Ten Tips for Flying with Fido\n\n\n\n\nTaking his first flight can be a somewhat traumatic experience for a dog that’s used to sticking his head out the car window and enjoying the sights along the way. After all, his view just won’t be the same from underneath the seat in front of you, or even worse, from the cargo hold. But getting there can still be half the fun if you follow the ten tips below and make sure you’re familiar with the [Airline Pet Policy](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/), restrictions on [Pet Travel in the US](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/us_regulations/), and any additional [International Pet Travel](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/international/) restrictions at your destination.\n\n\n## 1\\. Book early\n\nMost airlines only allow one or two dogs on each flight, so it’s important to book your dog’s ticket as soon as possible. Don’t buy your ticket until you call the airline and make sure there is a “seat” available for your dog on the flight. Once the agent has confirmed availability, reserve both your seats on the same ticket while you’re still on the phone with the agent.\n\n\n## 2\\. Fly direct\n\nBook a non-stop, direct flight whenever possible and try to fly on a weekday when airports are typically less hectic. If your pet will be traveling in the cargo hold, it’s best to fly in the morning or evening during the summer, and midday during the winter to avoid extremely hot or cold temperatures.\n\n\n## 3\\. Visit the veterinarian\n\nMake an appointment with your pet’s veterinarian for a check-up and make sure all vaccinations are up to date. Obtain a health certificate from your veterinarian dated within 10 days of departure. For travel outside the continental United States, additional planning and health care requirements may be necessary. Visit our International Pet Travel or contact the foreign office of the country you are traveling to for more information.\n\n\n## 4\\. Buy a carrier\n\nWhether your dog is a Chihuahua or a Great Dane, there’s a pet carrier to match. Carriers are available in both hard-sided and soft-sided. Soft-sided carriers are more suitable for carry-on and tend to fit better under the seat, but they’re only permitted in the cabin only. To make sure the carrier will fit under the seat on your flight check the size restrictions of the airline in our Airline Pet Policies section. If your dog will be traveling in the cargo hold, purchase a hard plastic carrier with holes for ventilation instead. Carriers must be big enough for your dog to stand, turn around, and lie down comfortably. If the carrier does not permit him to do this, the airline will refuse transport.\n\n\n## 5\\. Can I see some ID, ma’am?\n\nAfter you’ve purchased an appropriate carrier, write your dog’s name on it and include identification tags with your home address and phone number as well as the address and phone number of someone who can be reached at your destination. Carry a current photograph of your pet as well. If he’s lost during the trip, a photograph will make it much easier for airline employees or the local authorities to search effectively. You might also want to consider a permanent form of id (such as a microchip or tattoo) that will increase the likelihood of reuniting with your dog if he gets lost on the trip.\n\n\n## 6\\. Take a test drive\n\nAnimals travel under less stress when they are accustomed to their carrier before they travel. In the weeks prior to your trip, put your dog in his carrier as often as possible for trips around town.\n\n\n## 7\\. Eat, drink, poop, then play\n\nSince a full stomach might be uncomfortable for your dog during travel, we recommend feeding him about four hours before the flight, if possible. While it’s best to refrain from feeding your dog right before the flight, you can (and should) continue to give him water right up to the time of travel. Just be sure to empty the dish before checking in so it doesn’t spill during the flight. If you’re checking the dog, leave the dishes in the carrier so an airline employee can provide your pet with food and water in the event of an extended delay before or after your flight. You should also exercise your pet and let him use the facilities (i.e. grass) before heading to the airport.\n\n\n## 8\\. Arrive early\n\nArrive at the airport early, but not too early, and have your dog’s health certificate handy. You will not be allowed to check your pet in more than four hours before the flight. Most airlines recommend arriving two hours before your flight when traveling with a pet. Passengers with pets must check-in at the counter; curbside and self service check-in are not allowed.\n\n\n## 9\\. -Don’t- take a Valium\n\nWe don’t mind if you take a Valium before the flight, but don’t give your pet tranquilizers just because you’re nervous. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, in most cases, dogs should not be given sedatives or tranquilizers prior to flying because they can create respiratory and cardiovascular problems as the dog is exposed to increased altitude pressures. They can also alter the animal’s natural ability to balance and maintain equilibrium, which can be dangerous when the carrier is moved. While sedation is generally not advised, the decision on whether or not to prescribe a tranquilizer for your pet should be made by your veterinarian. If he or she decides that tranquilizers are medically necessary for the trip, indicate the name of the drug taken and the dosage on the dog’s carrier.\n\n\n## 10\\. You’ve arrived!\n\nWhen you arrive at your destination, go for a long walk before you check in at the hotel. Your dog will feel more comfortable as soon as he sees (and smells) his new surroundings, and realizes that the same rules and boundaries apply here too. By the time you check into the hotel, your dog will already feel right and home and be ready for whatever adventures are in store for him that week.\n\n\n* * *\n\n## Packing List\n\nDon’t forget these items when packing your dog’s suitcase:\n\n\n- Health certificate and medical records\n- Contact information for your regular veterinarian and an emergency contact at your destination\n- Comb, brush, and flea control products\n- Any special medication your dog might need\n- Spare collar with id tag\n- Pet wipes or grooming products\n- Paper towels and stain remover\n- Enough dog food and treats for the entire trip\n- Plenty of bottled water (a sudden change can upset your dog’s stomach)\n- Food and water dishes\n- Leash and poop bags\n- Your dog’s favorite toy and blanket\n- A list of [dog friendly restaurants](https://www.bringfido.com/restaurant/) and [attractions](https://www.bringfido.com/attraction/) at your destination\n\n\nYour Privacy\n\n\nWe use cookies to deliver our services, personalize content, and get feedback on how people use BringFido so that we can improve.\nBy clicking OK, you accept this as outlined in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.bringfido.com/privacy/#cookies).\n\n\nOK\n\n[iframe](https://www.bringfido.com/google/onetap/)",

    "markdown": "# Airline Pet Policies\n\nPlanning to fly with your dog? While air travel can be a quick way to get Fido from one place to another, you should know that every airline has different rules about transporting pets. Some allow small dogs to travel in the aircraft cabin as part of your carry-on luggage allowance, while others will only allow pets to travel in the cargo area, and fees can vary from nothing at all to more than $500. Also, most airlines only allow one or two dogs on each flight, so always make sure a “seat” is available for your dog BEFORE buying your own ticket.\n\n\nTo take off without a hitch, please read our [Ten Tips for Flying with Fido](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/top_10_tips/), and familiarize yourself with current [U.S. Travel Regulations](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/us_regulations/) or [International Pet Travel](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/international/) restrictions before you go.

In order to return to the United States, travelers with U.S.-vaccinated dogs must provide two documents per animal, the CDC Dog Import Form (completed online with an uploaded photo of your dog, taken recently or within 15 days before travel to the U.S. if under one year old) and a Certification of U.S-issued Rabies Vaccination form. Dogs can enter the U.S. at any airport, seaport or land border crossing, as long as the port matches your CDC Dog Import Form receipt. Additionally, dogs must appear healthy upon arrival, have a microchip detectable by a universal scanner that was implanted prior to the rabies vaccine, and be at least 6 months old at the time of entry to the U.S. Their microchip number must be included on all required forms and supporting documents. The required forms can be obtained at this [link](https://www.cdc.gov/importation/dogs/us-vaccinated-high-risk-countries.html).

However, we had an absolutely AWFUL experience today. Apparently, Hawaiian Airlines had updated their policy to require that dogs flying in-cabin must be able to stand in an upright manner (their heads held at neutral, above-body height) while in their carrier. With a carrier height restriction of a measly 9.5\", this is impossible for most dogs. When we called to reserve a spot for our dogs, we were only told the usual (i.e. carrier and weight limitations, and that dogs must be able to comfortably turn around and lie in their carrier). When we tried to check in with an agent at the guest services counter, she immediately glared at us and told us that she won't allow our dog on the plane. She was completely unsympathetic, unfriendly, and unhelpful. Her only solution was to leave and come back with a hard-sided carrier to throw her in cargo. After debating for some time, we just left and ran into another agent who was able to assist us and was extremely apologetic. Furthermore, the first agent almost denied entry for our tiny 8 pound dog! I completely understand that dogs should not be stuffed into a carrier without any space to move, but their new policy is way too strict. Just be warned that you may be denied entry if you encounter the wrong guest agent!\n\n- [![Summer](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/ZrBJhx36l8/SummerDien.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nSummer\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1582956)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nHawaiian Airlines new pet carrier policy doesn’t make sense\n\n\n\nI flew from Maui OGG to Kauai LIH with my cat and she was taller than 9.5” (which is the max height for the soft sided pet carrier) and they were giving me a hard time because she couldn’t stand in her carrier. But not many cats can with that height restriction. I even had my friend bring a hard carrier for the cargo section but it was still too small. Their policy is obviously do not take into consideration the size of pets. Hawaiian Airlines was not very helpful And just shrugged and told me that rules are rules. But they let me go with the exception that when I fly back to Maui that I would get a new carrier for her.\n\n- [![Betty](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nBetty\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1468081)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nNew requirements are impossible\n\n\n\nThe max size carrier of 16\" x 10\" x 9.5\" are impossible, because I cannot find a carrier that isn't at least 17\"! Before this was never a problem, but now with the new requirements I almost got turned away when taking my cat to the vet the other day. The gate agent at Kona was very curt, brought out a tape measure, told me I couldn't bring her in the cabin! I eventually was let onto the plane, but not until after a lot of back-and-forth.

At the Services desk, where one needs to check in with a pet, I was immediately denied because the agent said my 12 pound dog could not comfortably stand in his soft-sided kennel. Mind you, this is a regulation-size soft sided kennel in which he travels to and from Boston on two 6-hr legs usually via Seattle on excellent Alaska Airlines. We make the round trip twice annually and use the very kennel in which he arrived to HNL on a Hawaiian flight 51 hours ago. Speaking of his fellow Kona-based HA agents he said “they were wrong” to allow me to depart Kona, that there were new rules implemented on June 1 and, other than presenting a printed sheet of paper showing Hawaiian’s new policy, was unwilling to assist me. Distressed and nearly furious, I awaited another agent who at least had the good sense to contact a supervisor. About 30 minutes later (!) a supervisor named Wendy approached, apologized for her delay, explained the policy and allowed me to check in. The new policy apparently does not allow a pet whose head would extend above the carrier when unzipped to travel in the cabin. So you might be able to travel with a 5 pound Chihuahua or heavier low-slung dog. If this BringFido site still shows the image of a small, bright-eyed white canine with its head extending through its soft-sided kennel then BEWARE of travel on Hawaiian with any pet similar in size. My little guy is smaller than that and we almost got stranded at HNL, trying only to return home on a 49 minute flight.\n\n- [![Susan](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/895002/asid481959382342968height50width50ext1557607594hashAeTPlxNUUaPpGfZn?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nSusan\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/177529)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nHassled every time in Oahu\n\n\n\nI have traveled many times with my Dogue De Bordeaux as a service dog and know all the rules and paperwork required....Hawaiian Airlines in Kona and Hilo and Seattle are wonderful...every time I have to go through Oahu even on inter’-island they are rude and try to tell me why my dog cannot go on the airplane....inter-island Oahu asked for my paperwork...the only thing they are allowed to ask me is does my dog provide a service and what that is...This time I got right in her face and all of a sudden my dog was allowed through without them needing anything...interesting. Once I came through Seattle to Oahu and on to Kona and here they go again at H.A. Oahu counter. This supervisor had me in tears trying to refuse me because my letter was on the doctor’s prescription pad instead of letterhead...wow, really? Seattle didn’t mind, no one else ever had a problem with it ever....This woman was horrible...another woman at the counter came up to me and said if I just wouldn’t have shown the letter, they would have allowed me through...Really?? Incredible...\n\nI love flying Hawaiian Airlines and will continue to do so now that I know their game in Oahu\n\n- [![Derek](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nDerek\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/105509)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nGreat expirence\n\n\n\nWhile vacationing on Kauai last February we adopted \"Shamu\" our 4 year old black lab... Little did we know when adopting him that nobody would fly him back to Massachusetts for us.... except Hawaiian. We flew Shamu home via cargo and he was just fine!\n\n\n\nThe Humane Society was incredibly helpful in ensuring that we had all the correct paperwork for Shamu - but made one small mistake on his medical sheet. It wasn't a huge problem they quickly drew us up a new one and we ran over to get it (Only a few miles away).\n\n\n\nIf you make sure you get to your flight early and you have the proper paperwork easy peasy!\n\n\n\nI attached a nice little letter introducing himself to the airline staff and a little bag of candy for them as well. They treated our boy with much aloha and he had a great flight home.\n\n\n\nThe only caution I will give is if you are flying your dog into a cold climate... BEWARE! You MUST watch the weather reports like a hawk or your dog may not fly.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nHikari\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nNot Pet Friendly\n\n\n\nFiled a federal complaint against Hawaiian. I flew 3 different carriers with my pet and Hawaiian, the 4th carrier gave me the MOST problems. I checked in 3 hours before my flight from San Diego to Honolulu and they made me wait 2 hours while they went to process authorization. They then said they would make an exception and let me fly. I should have made them not make the exception as the Federal complaint was excused because the airline did allow me to fly. Big deal, they just got away with discrimination and will continue to do this over and over again. I guess they truly don't want to accept pets and if so, them they should just NOT do it.\n\n\n\nAlso, it is NOT Hawaii Quarrantine that doesn't allow the pets in the cabin as many are told. It is the AIRLINES who are refusing to allow the pets in cabin into Hawaii. Kudos to ALASKA AIR. They have no become my go to airline!!\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nAnna\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nNo wagging tails\n\n\n\ndesk lady asked how old my pet was and before I could say the month she insiseded on calling the supervisor saying my dog wasn't old enough.

I have tried very hard to speak with their public relations/customer service people at corporate to try to change this, but they absolutely will not respond. The people you get on the phone when you call their 800 number simply say it is \"Hawaii State Law\". I tried to explain to them that the Hawaii State Department of Agriculture told me directly that is not true. Although, you must go through a tremendous amount of red tape, the requirement to place the dogs in cargo coming into Hawaii is Hawaiian Airlines rule, not the state's. Alaska Airlines does allow small dogs to fly in the cabin with you coming into Hawaii. I hate to change Airlines, but my babies are too important to put through that kind of trauma.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nCheryl West\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nTerrified\n\n\n\nAfter the tremendous amount of paperwork Hawaii requires to bring your dog you would certainly expect Hawaiian Aire to accommodate travelers with their beloved pets.

I purchased a Noa pass which allows me 60 segments for the same price at anytime. I rarely know exactly when I fly and purchased the pass so I didn't have to deal w chance fees or hikes in last minute prices. I usually book my ticket 3 or 4 hrs prior to leaving.\n\nFlying w my dog is not a problem leaving honolulu. I usually call in to notify them I will be flying w her the moment I get my ticket. At the counter in honolulu, they follow procedure and do the checklist for my letter. I also make a copy for them so they don't have to go in the back to make a copy. They approve the letter, because I got it written exactly how they want it (that process is a whole other story) and they send me on my way.\n\nHowever, on Maui, they have consistently given me issues. They take my letter in the back and review it for over 20 mins leaving me w no one to talk to. They then say they need to review it w their supervisors and send the letter to someone up top. Honolulu does not to this, their staff are trained to process the letter. They are rude on maui. They tell me I need to not only call but also send in a copy of the letter 48 hrs in advance. This is not possible for people who travel frequently between islands and often book their flight only a fews hrs in advance. Further, sometimes I do not have access to a scanner or fax machine for the couple days I'm on maui. Everytime I'm on maui, the rude staff mention this woman Kristen Foster who apparently makes all these ridiculous rules and makes it a headache for people who travel w pets. I'm not sure why she is involved so much on maui, yet I never hear her name on oahu. I've heard other reviews where she has made life very difficult for people to fly w pets. Honest people, who are trying to follow the rules (which constantly chance) should not be treated this way. It is obvious that hawaiian airlines is trying to discourage people from flying w pets. Further, this ridiculous policy that they have come up w is not mandated by the federal government. I have flown on island air and they happily let my emmotional support dog on the plane w out any documentation and they also didn't even try to charge me. There is no one to talk to at hawaiian airlines about this issue. You are at the mercy of the staff at the check in desk. Even when u get your ducks in a row and follow their procedures, they come up w something else. This complaint is only directed at the staff at maui airport and this woman Kristen foster. Honolulu staff have been nothing but professional and kind. I hope hawaiian airlines looks into the rude behavior and irrational policies coming from the maui staff and Kristen foster.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nCelia\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nNot accomodating Pet\n\n\n\nI was to travel Alaska originally which had electrical problems. They purchased a ticket on Hawwaiian to accommodate me with my 4 lb chuahua. I was attempting to make my schedule with quarantine on a direct release from Las Vegas to Kahului HI. After I ran clear to the other end of the terminal the representatives would not let me on w/o a certificate from my Dr. stating I had special needs/assistance. in order for Zorro to ride in the cabin with me. I'm not impressed now that I read there policy and it states he could have flown with a $175 charge. Instead I ran back to Alaska which was great in the end. My poor dog was stuck in his kennel w/o bathroom from 4:45 AM LV time to 11:30 PM LV time when we arrived in Kahalui 8:30 PM. It just wasn't right.\n\nI showed all my paperwork for the 5 day or direct release program which should have sufficed.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nmike richards\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nHappy, happy ,happy\n\n\n\nI found the Hawaiian Airlines employees to be very friendly and helpful , I shipped my 106 lb. bull mastiff thru their cargo dept. from Seattle to Honolulu.

This is why i am writing another review if it keeps anyone else from going what we went through its worth it. My dogs flight from Seattle to Hilo was 16 hours. When i got to Oahu i ended up with a 5 hour wait to go to Hilo I tried to bump my dog to a earlier flight and was told i could. Was told to get a big cart and bring him from agriculture to the counter, after looking for a half hour for the cart only to be told i was that i could not use them, went back to tIcket counter only to have a new employee there who told me i could not bump him up and wanted to know who told me that. I explained that the previous employee told me, she wanted to know the persons name ( i did not know) she then told she me she could not help me but called a supervisor and tha'ts when things went very downhill. I wanted her to try and reach cargo as they were closed on the weekend ( which it was ) she would not and told me my dog was not flying from Oahu to Hilo in baggage because no dogs do. At that time i told her i was booked to Hilo through cargo and she wanted proof, cargo does not give you inter Island paperwork till you arrive at cargo so i had nothing to show her for the second half of the flight to Hilo. I think at this point she thought I was lying as she became rude, and nasty. she told me if i thought my dog was flying cargo than i should go there. I asked her where cargo was and she said at cargo i then again asked her where cargo was and she again nastily said at cargo, i then where is cargo located and she raised her voice and said at cargo. As i was walking away a employee whispered to me its on Elliott st. I then spent then next hour trying find a place to stay for the weekend in Oahu ( since the supervisor told me my dog was not flying and it was the weekend and when you call cargo it said it was closed ) could not find any opening to stay that would take a dog. I then called my husband in Hilo in tears telling him that i was more than likely going to rent a van and spend the weekend in a parking lot with our dog till i could talk to someone at cargo on monday. I then called a taxi and the driver was incredible he could tell i was very distressed and i told him what was happening and he told me dogs fly out of cargo all the time to Hilo and that cargo was open for dogs going out. He also told me that if for some reason they were not open he would help me so i did not have to sleep in a rented van. He also took my dog to a dog park so he could get out of his kennel for a short time. He took me to cargo and they were expecting and waiting for my dog and yes my dog was flying in baggage to Hilo just like I told the supervisor at Hawaiian. I paid $816.00 for my dog to fly from Seattle to Hilo and were abused for that money. Saddest of all was that the Hawaiian supervisor could have reached cargo and it would have been cleared up instead she chose not to help me and on top of it treat me very rudely. I complained to Hawaiian airline and they came back and said it was a misunderstanding and gave me 1000 miles. No apology for the treatment i received from her. we no longer fly Hawaiian. We own property on the big island and now use Alaska Airlines and its only $100 dollars each direction for your pet to fly, it goes in baggage not cargo. They allow you to put you dog on right before the flight, no 3 hours early in cargo ( which is just plain cruel. A vet meets us in Kona and inspects our dogs paperwork and then we drive to Hilo. I do not think Hawaiian should be allowed to fly pets especially when they are unwilling to help you if there is a problem. More than anything i am glad our dog survived, he was so traumatized it was horrifying. i do not want anyone to go through what we went through.It was one of the most traumatizing thing I have been through. I take responsibilty for using Hawaiian cargo and learned a hard lesson from it never again. We even canceled our Hawaiian credit card.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nLila\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nVery Pleased\n\n\n\nOn our move to Hawai with our dogs, Hawaiian was very Helpful. When we boarded we told the flight attendant that we had 2 dogs in cargo. He went to check that they were boarded, then went to check himself. They were under the pilots where the fresh air comes in and they kept the light on for them. When we got them from the animal office -they were ready for release as soon as we landed, got our bags and got to the office. They were very helpful in making our and our dogs flights very comfortable.\n\n\nLoad More Reviews\n\nLoading…\n\nFailed.\n[Post a Review](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/15/review/)![Bubble](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bubble.svg)\n\nPost a Review\n\n\n## Traveler Photos\n\n\nWe haven‘t received any photos of dogs flying Hawaiian Airlines yet.\n\n\n\n\nWant to feature your creature?

    "markdown": "# Airline Pet Policies\n\nPlanning to fly with your dog? While air travel can be a quick way to get Fido from one place to another, you should know that every airline has different rules about transporting pets. Some allow small dogs to travel in the aircraft cabin as part of your carry-on luggage allowance, while others will only allow pets to travel in the cargo area, and fees can vary from nothing at all to more than $500. Also, most airlines only allow one or two dogs on each flight, so always make sure a “seat” is available for your dog BEFORE buying your own ticket.\n\n\nTo take off without a hitch, please read our [Ten Tips for Flying with Fido](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/top_10_tips/), and familiarize yourself with current [U.S. Travel Regulations](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/us_regulations/) or [International Pet Travel](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/international/) restrictions before you go.

Pets are welcome to travel in the cabin and as checked baggage in the hold with KLM.\n\n\n[Visit Website](https://www.klm.com/travel/us_en/prepare_for_travel/travel_planning/pets/index.htm)\n\n\nOr call [(866) 434-0320](tel:+18664340320) for more information.\n\n\nYou can use BringFido to find a [pet friendly place to stay](https://www.bringfido.com/lodging/) at your destination.\n\n\n## Pets in the Cabin\n\nKLM welcomes small cats and dogs into the economy cabin on most of their flights, and in business class on flights within Europe. Dogs are welcome in the cabin if the combined weight of the pet and carrier is under 18 lbs (8 kg). Each passenger is permitted to travel with 1 pet. To bring your cat or dog with you, you’ll pay a fee of EUR 75 to EUR 400 per one-way.\n\n## Pets in Checked Baggage\n\nPets and carriers weighing more than 18 lbs (8 kg) can be transported in the hold with KLM. To travel as checked baggage in the hold, pets and carriers can weigh a maximum 165 lbs (75 kg). Passengers can check up to 3 pets in the hold. If you have a transfer time of more than 3 hours, or your flight is operated with a Boeing 787-9 or 787-10 aircraft, then you are not allowed to travel with a pet in the hold. To bring your cat or dog with you, you’ll pay a fee of EUR 75 to EUR 400 per one-way.\n\n## Pets in Cargo\n\nPets that exceed the maximum weight for traveling in the hold, those traveling alone, or animals that are heading to countries where they require pets to be transported as freight, can all go through Air France-KLM Cargo instead, where animals are shipped with a special cargo agent. Pets and carriers weighing more than 165 lbs (75 kg) or exceeding 115\" (292 cm) in height must travel this way. On some types of aircraft, the kennel must not be larger than 97\" (247 cm). You can contact them directly at 800-556-9000 to find out prices, availability, and conditions for your pet's travel plans.\n\n## Carrier Guidelines\n\nFor animals traveling in the cabin, carriers must be soft-sided and no bigger than 18\" x 11\" x 9\" (46 cm x 28 cm x 24 cm). Pets must be able to stand up and lay down comfortably inside. For pets traveling in the hold, carriers must not exceed the dimensions of 48\" x 32\" x 35\" (122 cm x 81 cm x 89 cm) on KLM flights and 40\" x 27\" x 30\" (102 cm x 69 cm x 76 cm) on KLM Cityhopper flights. Carriers must alsohave a fiberglass or rigid plastic shell, wheels must be removed or blocked with duct tape, the door must have a centralized locking system, and the two parts of the carrier must be joined by bolts. It must be large enough for your pet to stand up without touching the top, turn around easily, and lie down in a natural position.\n\n## Other Restrictions\n\nUnfortunately, snub-nosed breeds are not allowed to travel with KLM. Animals of this type must be transported via KLM Cargo. The following dog breeds are not accepted for travel with KLM: Affenpinscher, American Bully, Boston Terrier, Boxers (all breeds), Bulldogs (all breeds), Bull Mastiff, Cane Corso, Pugs (all breeds), Chow-Chow, Great Dane (all breeds), Certain breeds of Spaniel (Tibetan, Japanese, English, King Charles), Brussels Griffon, Lhasa Apso, Mastiffs (all breeds), Neapolitan Mastiff, Pekingese, Small Brabant, Shih Tzu, Shar Pei, Staffordshire Bull Terrier. The following cat breeds are not permitted: Burmese, Exotic Shorthair, Himalayan, and Persian.\n\n## Reviews\n\nBringFido Guest Rating\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKLM Royal Dutch Airlines has received a rating of 4.0 out of 5 bones by 0 canine critics on BringFido.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/loading.svg)\n\nLoading reviews…\n\nUnable to load.\n\n\n- [![Nele](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/URwVloSPcR/asid10200541726205621height50width50ext1636386933hashAeT8IvGRdaILBIYeRpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nNele\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/847841)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nGreat experience, kind staff\n\n\n\nI flew with my cat in the cabin from Netherlands to Spain.

On both flights the very nice staff reassurede that my dog was indeed on board and that the pressure and the temperature is fine for my dog in the luggage department in the belly of the plane. When I arrived to Mexico I was surprised to see that the kennel of my dog was replaced by a bigger one, to make her feel more comfortable.

Pets are welcome to fly in the cabin and as cargo on select flights with American Airlines.\n\n\n[Visit Website](https://www.aa.com/i18n/travel-info/special-assistance/pets.jsp)\n\n\nOr call [(800) 433-7300](tel:+18004337300) for more information.\n\n\nYou can use BringFido to find a [pet friendly place to stay](https://www.bringfido.com/lodging/) at your destination.\n\n\n## Pets in the Cabin\n\nAmerican Airlines allows cats and dogs to travel in the cabin if they are at least 8 weeks old and the combined weight of the pet and carrier does not exceed 20 lbs (9 kg). Small pets must remain completely inside a carrier and under the seat during the entire flight. Pet carriers are no longer considered as part of a passenger's carry-on allowance, and passengers may now bring a personal item or carry-on bag in addition to a pet carrier. The fee for pets traveling in the cabin is $150 each way.\n\n## Pets in Checked Baggage\n\nAmerican Airlines accepts up to 2 pets as checked baggage for active-duty U.S. military and U.S. State Department Foreign Service personnel traveling on official orders. Unfortunately, other pets are not permitted as checked baggage. The fee for pets traveling as cargo is $150-$200 each way.\n\n## Pets in Cargo\n\nDogs and cats can be transported as cargo with American Airlines Cargo, also known as American PetEmbark.

Some reviewers noted that the experience can depend on the individual agent, but most were able to successfully travel with their pets in the cabin. A few customers had issues with agents being overly strict about size or height requirements, but overall the airline seems open to allowing pets on flights as long as guidelines are followed.\n\n\nAI-generated from the text of reviews\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/loading.svg)\n\nLoading reviews…\n\nUnable to load.\n\n\n- [![Izzie](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/KmlcaVBQKh/IzzieJ.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nIzzie\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nDec. 25, 2024](https://www.bringfido.com/user/2091679)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nEverything went well\n\n\n\nI flew twice so far with AA with my 6 pound poodle. She is tiny, but her long legs don't allow her to stand up without touching the top of the carrier, so I was nervous.\n\nWhen I flew from Montreal, the agent looked at my dog that I was carrying in my arms. He didn't ask to see the carrier or anyhting. He filled up the checklist let us through.\n\n\n\nWhen I flew from NY LGA, my dog was already in the carrier and the agent just asked me to open and took a look at the dog. She said it was fine, filled the checklist and let us through. No one measured or weighed anything. We will soon fly from Knoxville soon, but I am obviously less nervous than I was after these two positive experiences.\n\nI am using a Mr Peanuts carrier that measures 11\"x11\"×17 3/4. It fit perfectly under the seat. We put it horizontally and even opened the extension to give Nevy more space during the flight.\n\n- [![Karina](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/HXCZjAzyZc/KarinaWyczynski.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nKarina\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nJul. 29, 2024](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1960303)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nAmerican Airlines Phoenix\n\n\n\nI was a nervous wreck after reading the reviews. I have a 21 pound mini poodle. I weighed him at home in his soft crate and he was around 23 pounds + he has longish legs. He fits comfortably in a 19x13x9 soft crate (brand: PidiPiti off Amazon). I set him down on the scale and it showed 24.5 pounds so I was still a nervous wreck about it. Meanwhile, the agent asked me what kind of animal it is and if she could see him. I popped his head out of the top of the carrier and she said “oh you are a little bigger.” Proceeded to hand me paperwork to sign regarding the dog, I paid the pet fee, and we were on our way. I have friends that travel with their dogs and they also mentioned not having any issues and people are more likely to leave reviews when they have a bad experience rather than good. Unless I got lucky, it really was a smooth experience. I paid extra to have a “main cabin extra” seat and I think it definitely helped the situation too. There was extra leg room and he fit great under the seat. Flight attendants were great. Truly, no complaints. I hope it continues to be like this because he is such an easy traveler!\n\n- [![Leka](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/6o8e67VuWa/LekaRomao.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nLeka\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1705493)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nBest Experience in cabin with my pup\n\n\n\nWe were worried about flying across the country (San Diego to Pittsburgh) with my 17lbs (20.6lbs with the Sherpa carrier) poddle mix. The experience was so flawless that I couldn’t not write this review. Will drop a few tips below as well.\n\n\n\nWhen we first arrived at the SD airport checkin, my dog was sitting down with the Sherpa top zipper open. The lady was questioning that she was looking a bit too big for the carrier, and politely asked me to see her fully inside. I dropped a treat in her bag, and zipped up the top completely. She smiled and asked me to weigh my pup, 20lbs no problem. On the way back (PIT airport) I already walked into checkin with her fully inside/zipped, and the lady didn’t even ask for anything nor asked to weigh her OR sign anything. So pro tip: bring your pet already inside the carrier when you walk into checkin to avoid questions.\n\n\n\nSame goes for boarding the plane (we had stops in Chicago on the way in and in DFW on the way back). For all 4 flights we boarded the plane with my bb already in the carrier/zipped, and some flight attendants even asked “puppy!! what kind is it??” and overall got super excited to have a pup in the flight. During takeoff, I kept her under the seat in front of me, but she was never fully zipped in, and appreciated being able to keep and eye on us, and getting some pets. Once we were up in the air, for most of the flight we took her out of the carrier and she slept alll the way (she doesn’t need meds and is very calm when traveling) in between our seats. I’m sure flight attendants saw it, and never asked or bothered us at all, since she was extremely calm and just napping between our seats.\n\n\n\nThis was her second time on a plane. First was Southwest to New Orleans last May, and it was also a great experience, except that multiple times we got asked to put her fully zipped up inside the bag. With this not having happened a single time with us in any of the 4 airports or planes, I need to say this was a flawless experience, and it made American my first choice when bringing my pup. I wish they would do South America flights with pups in cabin again, will definitely choose them again.\n\n\n\nQuick info: pup is a 2.5yo, 17lbs poodle mix. Didn’t use any sedatives or medicine at all, just a lot of treats, toys and blankets to keep her cozy. We upgraded our seats for more leg room, def recommend if you’re able to.\n\n- [![Megan](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/0Hi31R2H2L/MeganEaton.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nMegan\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1664775)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nEasy first trip with my cat\n\n\n\nAfter reading reviews on this website was convinced I was going to get turned away. I took my cat on his first trip Bradley to Charlotte. I had the best time ever at check in and the dog getting checking in front of me had the wrong carrier and they were allowed to buy a new one and just go through TSA. Both customer service people at both airports were super nice. The Charlotte one signed my pet agreement for me. Honestly I think it’s more trouble for them to turn your pet away than to just let you be happy. I wasn’t even asked if he was on medication. I opted for light meds for fear and stress. I went with priority boarding in group 5 and had the extra leg room seat going. It was perfect. Next time I’d try to book extra leg room on both flights. Regular seats are kinda tight. My carrier was slightly longer, I had no drama as long as he met the 20lbs requirement. Over all it was the best experience for my cat’s first flight.\n\n- [![Tara](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nTara\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1660646)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nSeamless!!\n\n\n\nI was beyond worried about flying with my 10.5 week old English Bulldog puppy. He is around 20 pounds and was so nervous based on reviews. It could not have been smoother. I purchased the Sherpa Delta carrier that’s 18x11x11. I got to the check in counter and the lady immediately asked for my card to pay the $125 fee. She weighed him in the carrier and he was 23 lbs. After I signed a piece of paper I was on my way!\n\n- [![Hillary](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/CrFMziQwPF/HillaryEllman.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nHillary\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1655642)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nDon't Worry- Policy Changed\n\n\n\nPosting this review in hopes of providing peace of mind for those who, like myself, worry about every detail when traveling and find themselves on this site. I have always avoided flying American when I need to travel with my dog due to the horror stories I've seen here. On a recent trip from PDX to DFW, I had no choice but to book myself and my dog on American. I was worried but had a little hope given the recent reviews here saying the policy has changed (though I still had a backup plan in case they turned my dog away), and my experience was totally seamless! My 14-pound Pekingese mix had absolutely no trouble in PDX or DFW. They didn't question the size of the carrier, make him turn around, or check whether he could fully stand up in his bag. I took off one bone as they did weigh him inside the carrier to make sure he was under the 21-pound limit-- we came out to 18 pounds (no other airline has made me do this, and my dog, despite being pretty tiny, was a little close to the limit-- so it is a bit more exclusive than other airlines). After weighing and signing the form saying that the carrier was regulation size and I wouldn't let him out while in-flight, we were totally good to go. I recommend ordering a bag scale so you can weigh your dog/carrier before flying to give yourself peace of mind and avoid surprises, but if you're good there, you should be good to go!\n\n- [![Eth](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/Y4hNY56Wl1/Eth.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nEth\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1573684)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nJust don't...\n\n\n\nI know there are some outliers here that have had good experiences, but GENERALLY, you'll have a bad experience with AA and your pet. It largely depends on who the person at the counter is. My lady started the paperwork after weighing my dog until some old lady came and whispered in her ear to check my bag size. The AA website tells you a RECOMMENDED size, it doesn't say under or over the recommended size. I figured that since it was only 2 inches taller, it wouldn't be an issue. After all, does anyone actually slide their carry on bags completely under the chair? Anyway, after the initial lady helping me at the front desk was forced (or it seemed like it by the old lady) to measure my bag, she told me I was over by 2. I showed her how it says this is a recommended size online and what her paper says, differ.\n\n\n\nWhile waiting for the supervisor, I began asking a few questions to the old lady. She wanted nothing to do with me, and would not look or speak to me. I was still respectful at this point. Then the supervisor came over and bluntly told me it was too large. I then showed her what it says online and she told me to use common sense. At first she told me the bag was too large. When I proved her wrong, she told me my dog was too large. My dog is under the 20lb limit. He has long legs, but he still fits comfortable in the bag and can spin around and lay down. I prefer if she just told me that my bag was too large lol. After the common sense comment, she told me to \"look at my dog, he's not OK.\" I treat my dog like an absolute king that he is, do not tell me otherwise lady. I was furious at this point and simply left after telling them to F off with my middle finger. They said \"Right back at ya!\" - lol.\n\n\n\nBack to my initial point, it depends who is at the front desk. It's safer to travel with another airline because AA just likes to toss the dice & gable with ya. It's a shame because I used to swear by AA, even when other dog owners told me that SW & Delta are better. I stuck to AA regardless & this is where it got me. Y'all lot a loyal customer.\n\n- [![Skip](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/HbXA7in2vN/SkipBaker.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nSkip\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1548222)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nGreat Experience\n\n\n\nI followed all of the rules and had no trouble whatsoever.

Not for carry on, which we were doing. The soft carrier was within the size dimensions but they rejected us because the supervisor on duty was uncaring and enforcing an unwritten rule, but we called reservations and they wouldn't help because it was a problem at the airport so we have to complain through customer relations. We cancelled our flight...overall awful experience.\n\n- [![MC](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nMC\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1519213)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nPet Policy has changed!\n\n\n\nI was very stressed after reading all of these reviews saying that AA enforced their \"stand up and turn around policy\" only to find out that they have recently removed this from their policy because so many people complained! My pup is 6 months old and has very long legs for a chihuahua mix so I was anticipating push back on her AA sized approved carrier. They didn't even measure my carrier and just weighed her in it which was 18 lbs. The customer service rep was thrilled to tell me that the policy changed because it became such a hassle! I hope this relieves anyone from choosing AA because if there was going to be a problem I was definitely going to stop using them. My only qualm is that even though the carrier was approved, the space under the seat was very tight and didn't allow for the carrier to go all the way under. Might be smart to upgrade if you can to have more room for you and your pup!\n\n- [![Gabby](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/QeiyMnke3K/GabbySmith.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nGabby\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1508366)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nNo issues traveling with pet\n\n\n\nI normally do not leave reviews, but felt the need to post my experiences flying with American with my 8 week old pet. I never flew with American, so I was nervous from the beginning. I flew from Houston to Miami (and back to Houston). I did not have any issues with the process of flying with my pet. Customer service at the airport was very helpful. They did not ask my dog to move around like, stand, sit etc. like I read in some reviews. The customer services rep jsut looked to make sure my puppy was in the carrier and he fit in the carrier. I paid my pet fee and was off to my gate. Now, the customer service reps at the gate looked like they hated their jobs and did not want to work yet alone help out a passanger. One of the workers looked annoyed when myself or another passanger asked her a question. However, the manager on duty was very helpful and happy to help anyone. The carrier I purchased was the correct dimentions that is on American's website. The carrier I had was a little snug under the seat, and it did not fit completely under the seat. If you can, I suggest spending a little extra money to get a seat with extra leg room. I was upgraded to the main cabin on the way to Miami and I feel like the main cabin would have been better with my pet. Besides the unhappy aggent at the gate, my experience was good.\n\n- [![Marie](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nMarie\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1299673)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nExcellent Experience\n\n\n\nAfter reading the reviews we were scared about flying with our French Bulldog puppy to visit family over this Memorial Day weekend.

Alaska has been great. Southwest was great, but American seems to just not want any in cabin pets. Despite having flown the same route before, we were held up by a gate agent in BUR in CA. She said our dogs were suddenly too big for their carriers. They're on the larger side for an in cabin pet, but can very comfortably fit in their airline approved carriers and turn around. They're perfectly well behaved, but it was clear from the moment she walked into the room huffing that she was interested in ruining someone's day. Having worked for many years in customer service, I calmly and kindly tried working with her. Even going so far to fill out the service animal paperwork since all of their training and medical documents are in order. However, this woman made us take the dogs out of their carriers to \"measure them\" and another dog lunged at them. One of them yipped (playfully), but that was all. Then she said a service dog would never bark (not true, but whatever) and that now she could not allow our dogs to be service animals at American. I promptly walked over to Alaska and Southwest to try and find a new similar flight and both were accommodating and assured me that of course my dogs fit in their carriers. Having worked and planned so extensively with their trainer and vet, I was deeply insulted by this gate agents behavior. Long story short, STAY AWAY. We ended up paying more than double to fly out last minute with another airline.\n\n- [![Allie](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nAllie\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1186998)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nAA obviously does not want dogs to fly in the cabin\n\n\n\nThe counter agent in Columbus, Ohio was rude and condescending from the moment we stepped to the counter. We have flown with our 14 pound (13.5 year old) Shih Tzu multiple times on other airlines with no issue. The agent claimed our dog wasn’t safe and didn’t fit the carrier after he demanded that she turn around and she would not. He stated he would not allow her to fly and we could speak with the manager. I’m not even sure why we waited to speak with the manager because it was obvious after he was whispering with the agent that he was not going to reconsider. He claimed it was a TSA requirement that he could see her turn in her carrier and by the time he was talking with us, she was now laying in her carrier and since she wouldn’t get up and turn around (again it was clear he had no intention of considering allowing her), he denied us boarding. Since we knew she has flown with no issues at Southwest, we went down to the counter and showed them her in her carrier (laying down asleep at this point) and asked if they had a flight available and if there were any issues with her fit in the carrier. The agents said she was completely fine and could tell there was no issue with her fitting appropriately in the carrier. They were appalled when we shared how we were treated by AA. They shared that there is nothing that forces an owner to prove a dog can stand up and turn around (she can - she didn’t want to) and that it was clear to them that her size was no issue. We were grateful for their kindness and they were more than happy to book us on an alternate flight with them. We will never consider flying AA again. Truly, AA - if you don’t want pets in cabin, just make that a policy. Do not instead put people through that as they have gone through all the motions for preparing for a flight.

I first flew from the Denver airport. I took a red eye and it was spring break so it was very busy at check in. The check in person just asked to see my dog in the carrier and asked if he could turn around. Did not ask to see him turn around. I had to fill out a sheet of information. He did not weigh my dog. My dog has separation anxiety so I was worried about him under the seat but he just went right to sleep since it was midnight. I flew back to Denver from Miami airport which I was more worried about. They just weighed him and we were on the way. At both airports they wiped my hands when I went through security. He cried alittle on the plane but I gave him bones and when they turned the lights off he fell asleep. Hope this helps with your travel anxiety. I read all the reviews before I flew and I was soooo scared.

Our dog is a very good travel dog. We always check and follow the airline rules for travel. Never once have we had check in problems with airlines like JetBlue. Now, American Airlines, on the other hand, is flat out terrible. The check in staff at the ticket counter in Jacksonville (JAX) airport was beyond ridiculous today. They tried to reject our dog as not approved. Our small dog easily, repeatedly turned about inside our soft pet carrier that meets AA regulation size. The check in rep said the dog didn’t fit in her carrier, a carrier which fits small dogs up to 20lbs. Our small Westie easily fits in the soft carrier and turned around several times in front of the rep. The rep suggested the dog couldn’t use her legs. We asked how would it be possible for the dog to turnaround so fast and easily if she wasn’t standing and turning. The whole exchange was absurd. We will no longer travel on AA as they’ve tried to reject our small dog in an approved carrier and their reasoning didn’t make sense. The AA rep was completely unreasonable and her manager begrudgingly approved the dog to fly but then the rep later suggested she was going to note our file as ban from dog travel due to the dog being too big. Huh? Weird. These front counter AA reps need far better training. We dearly love our pet and would never do anything harmful to our dog. We take excellent care of her. We’d never squish her in an ill fitting travel carrier. Never. After the harassing and insulting exchange, we’ve had it with AA. We were friendly and respectful in our exchange with the rep yet sadly we can’t say we got the same in return. We’ll take our travel money and little dog and fly other airlines as their service was idiotic and unjustifiably harassing of long time loyal customers. Super disappointed in the American Airlines reps conduct and we were highly offended at the suggestion of banning our dog. Utterly ridiculous and unjustifiable experience.\n\n- [![Amy](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/M6aM9C1MGB/AmyHutchison.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nAmy\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1231016)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nCharlotte and Ft Myers airport get 5 bones\n\n\n\nI know others have said they’ve had issues so I wanted to write a good review to let those of you checking it out to be cautiously optimistic.\n\n\n\nI have a 17 pound jack Russell terrier. I got a 12 inch height carrier which is slightly larger than the AA guidelines, but she still was right at the max of how comfortable I would be having her in it.\n\n\n\n(CLT airport) I had her in the carrier when I brought her to check in. I explained that I had filled her carrier with things like her leash, treats, etc… so she would be overweight but I could pull those out if necessary. She said she doesn’t care about the weight. The agent then asked me to have her turn around and face the other way. She can do it, but she kind of crouches when she does so I was nervous about this. She said, “she looks good” and finished. TSA was super friendly with her and even asked for pets.\n\n\n\n(RSW/Ft Myers airport) They didn’t even look at her. “She’s good.” And waved me through. Please note this airport doesn’t have any inside pet relief areas so make sure to take yours outside before security.\n\n\n\nIt is very possible to fly with a pet on AA, even if they are on the larger size of the guidelines.\n\n- [![Christine](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nChristine\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1266426)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nNot worth trying!\n\n\n\nWe have traveled with our 10 pound dog before on AA. Following all the guidelines- getting him the required carrier, having a vet checkup prior to flight, reserving his spot well in advance. The last time we traveled on AA (only a few months prior, leaving from the same exact departure airport) there were no issues. Today, they claimed he was too large to move comfortably in his carrier for for his 1.5 hour flight. They said we could acquire a larger bag and then be able to get on our flight. They suggested visiting United and Southwest to ask to purchase one of their carriers (again, despite the fact that we had the carrier that fits AA’s size guidelines specifically). When visiting other ticket counter, they told us they were unable to sell (or even show us) their carriers unless we were flying with them. We went back to the AA counter to see what the next steps were and the new agent that was helping us had no hesitation to allow our dog to board the plane. Even happily charged the fee to our card! It wasn’t until at the ticket printing stage did she say “oh somebody said the dog is actually too big”. When we told them he flew previously on their airline in the same carrier the woman said “dogs grow”. Huh?! He’s still way below the size max that are listed!! The most infuriating part was there were no next steps. No offer to help get us on a flight out the next day. Nothing. Just “here are your IDs back” while simultaneously fawning over how cute he. All the while he was stressing out over being forced to do circles in his carrier while propped on the luggage scale in front of an audience of 5 employees. Of course now nobody will speak to us about a refund, but they were happy to immediately cancel our first class seats to make them available on the flight.\n\n\n\nJust say you don’t allow dogs!!\n\n- [![JF](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/Qoa99n91iD/3BAD1F89-0173-47F4-9FDE-D4BE1A221F0C.jpeg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nJF\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1263805)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nRude and Nasty about 13 lb dog in Panama City airport FL\n\n\n\nFirst of all, let me say I used to fly AA weekly for work and have a high status. I will never fly this airline again or only as last resort.\n\nWe have flown cross country numerous times with our petite 13 lb Cavalier King Charles Spaniel on Delta and United with no issues.\n\nOn Dec 17th we went to our little airport in northern FL - Panama City Beach and the agent checked my dog’s carrier and said it was fine and took our payment and just as she was just about done, another agent butted in and said she needed to check the carrier again as she thought it was too small for our dog. She made me put her in the case and zip it again and get her to stand up and turn around and then said - Nope it’s too small for her. We went through 4 levels of supervisors and me totally red in face with anger before they finally approved her to fly. My poor dog was totally flipped out as they made me take her in and out of her crate so many times. They were making all these excuses that TSA would not approve and that the Pilot would report them and then lied and said she couldn’t have her blanket or little stuffed animal in there. They were rude from the get go - never apologized and caused us to spend 45 minutes at the ticket counter. I will be tweeting about this and writing to AA CEO. They wouldn’t give us their names either but my husband took a picture of them. At least we got to fly with her to NY in our original first class seats but we are done with American Airlines. You lost a customer forever!!!\n\n\nLoad More Reviews\n\nLoading…\n\nFailed.\n[Post a Review](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/2/review/)![Bubble](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bubble.svg)\n\nPost a Review\n\n\n## Traveler Photos\n\n\nWe haven‘t received any photos of dogs flying American Airlines yet.\n\n\n\n\nWant to feature your creature?

However, we had an absolutely AWFUL experience today. Apparently, Hawaiian Airlines had updated their policy to require that dogs flying in-cabin must be able to stand in an upright manner (their heads held at neutral, above-body height) while in their carrier. With a carrier height restriction of a measly 9.5\", this is impossible for most dogs. When we called to reserve a spot for our dogs, we were only told the usual (i.e. carrier and weight limitations, and that dogs must be able to comfortably turn around and lie in their carrier). When we tried to check in with an agent at the guest services counter, she immediately glared at us and told us that she won't allow our dog on the plane. She was completely unsympathetic, unfriendly, and unhelpful. Her only solution was to leave and come back with a hard-sided carrier to throw her in cargo. After debating for some time, we just left and ran into another agent who was able to assist us and was extremely apologetic. Furthermore, the first agent almost denied entry for our tiny 8 pound dog! I completely understand that dogs should not be stuffed into a carrier without any space to move, but their new policy is way too strict. Just be warned that you may be denied entry if you encounter the wrong guest agent!\n\n- [![Summer](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/ZrBJhx36l8/SummerDien.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nSummer\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1582956)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nHawaiian Airlines new pet carrier policy doesn’t make sense\n\n\n\nI flew from Maui OGG to Kauai LIH with my cat and she was taller than 9.5” (which is the max height for the soft sided pet carrier) and they were giving me a hard time because she couldn’t stand in her carrier. But not many cats can with that height restriction. I even had my friend bring a hard carrier for the cargo section but it was still too small. Their policy is obviously do not take into consideration the size of pets. Hawaiian Airlines was not very helpful And just shrugged and told me that rules are rules. But they let me go with the exception that when I fly back to Maui that I would get a new carrier for her.\n\n- [![Betty](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nBetty\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1468081)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nNew requirements are impossible\n\n\n\nThe max size carrier of 16\" x 10\" x 9.5\" are impossible, because I cannot find a carrier that isn't at least 17\"!

Luckily my wife is skilled at working with entitled people as a hotel front desk agent. She was able to stroke the lady’s egos just enough to get our dogs processed in time. We almost missed our connecting flight to Maui from California because the quarantine employees seemed to have some office drama going on between them.

At the Services desk, where one needs to check in with a pet, I was immediately denied because the agent said my 12 pound dog could not comfortably stand in his soft-sided kennel. Mind you, this is a regulation-size soft sided kennel in which he travels to and from Boston on two 6-hr legs usually via Seattle on excellent Alaska Airlines. We make the round trip twice annually and use the very kennel in which he arrived to HNL on a Hawaiian flight 51 hours ago. Speaking of his fellow Kona-based HA agents he said “they were wrong” to allow me to depart Kona, that there were new rules implemented on June 1 and, other than presenting a printed sheet of paper showing Hawaiian’s new policy, was unwilling to assist me. Distressed and nearly furious, I awaited another agent who at least had the good sense to contact a supervisor. About 30 minutes later (!) a supervisor named Wendy approached, apologized for her delay, explained the policy and allowed me to check in. The new policy apparently does not allow a pet whose head would extend above the carrier when unzipped to travel in the cabin. So you might be able to travel with a 5 pound Chihuahua or heavier low-slung dog. If this BringFido site still shows the image of a small, bright-eyed white canine with its head extending through its soft-sided kennel then BEWARE of travel on Hawaiian with any pet similar in size. My little guy is smaller than that and we almost got stranded at HNL, trying only to return home on a 49 minute flight.\n\n- [![Susan](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/895002/asid481959382342968height50width50ext1557607594hashAeTPlxNUUaPpGfZn?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nSusan\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/177529)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nHassled every time in Oahu\n\n\n\nI have traveled many times with my Dogue De Bordeaux as a service dog and know all the rules and paperwork required....Hawaiian Airlines in Kona and Hilo and Seattle are wonderful...every time I have to go through Oahu even on inter’-island they are rude and try to tell me why my dog cannot go on the airplane....inter-island Oahu asked for my paperwork...the only thing they are allowed to ask me is does my dog provide a service and what that is...This time I got right in her face and all of a sudden my dog was allowed through without them needing anything...interesting. Once I came through Seattle to Oahu and on to Kona and here they go again at H.A. Oahu counter. This supervisor had me in tears trying to refuse me because my letter was on the doctor’s prescription pad instead of letterhead...wow, really? Seattle didn’t mind, no one else ever had a problem with it ever....This woman was horrible...another woman at the counter came up to me and said if I just wouldn’t have shown the letter, they would have allowed me through...Really?? Incredible...\n\nI love flying Hawaiian Airlines and will continue to do so now that I know their game in Oahu\n\n- [![Derek](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nDerek\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/105509)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nGreat expirence\n\n\n\nWhile vacationing on Kauai last February we adopted \"Shamu\" our 4 year old black lab... Little did we know when adopting him that nobody would fly him back to Massachusetts for us.... except Hawaiian. We flew Shamu home via cargo and he was just fine!\n\n\n\nThe Humane Society was incredibly helpful in ensuring that we had all the correct paperwork for Shamu - but made one small mistake on his medical sheet. It wasn't a huge problem they quickly drew us up a new one and we ran over to get it (Only a few miles away).\n\n\n\nIf you make sure you get to your flight early and you have the proper paperwork easy peasy!\n\n\n\nI attached a nice little letter introducing himself to the airline staff and a little bag of candy for them as well. They treated our boy with much aloha and he had a great flight home.\n\n\n\nThe only caution I will give is if you are flying your dog into a cold climate... BEWARE!

I flew 3 different carriers with my pet and Hawaiian, the 4th carrier gave me the MOST problems. I checked in 3 hours before my flight from San Diego to Honolulu and they made me wait 2 hours while they went to process authorization. They then said they would make an exception and let me fly. I should have made them not make the exception as the Federal complaint was excused because the airline did allow me to fly. Big deal, they just got away with discrimination and will continue to do this over and over again. I guess they truly don't want to accept pets and if so, them they should just NOT do it.\n\n\n\nAlso, it is NOT Hawaii Quarrantine that doesn't allow the pets in the cabin as many are told. It is the AIRLINES who are refusing to allow the pets in cabin into Hawaii. Kudos to ALASKA AIR.

I have tried very hard to speak with their public relations/customer service people at corporate to try to change this, but they absolutely will not respond. The people you get on the phone when you call their 800 number simply say it is \"Hawaii State Law\". I tried to explain to them that the Hawaii State Department of Agriculture told me directly that is not true. Although, you must go through a tremendous amount of red tape, the requirement to place the dogs in cargo coming into Hawaii is Hawaiian Airlines rule, not the state's. Alaska Airlines does allow small dogs to fly in the cabin with you coming into Hawaii.

I purchased a Noa pass which allows me 60 segments for the same price at anytime. I rarely know exactly when I fly and purchased the pass so I didn't have to deal w chance fees or hikes in last minute prices. I usually book my ticket 3 or 4 hrs prior to leaving.\n\nFlying w my dog is not a problem leaving honolulu. I usually call in to notify them I will be flying w her the moment I get my ticket. At the counter in honolulu, they follow procedure and do the checklist for my letter. I also make a copy for them so they don't have to go in the back to make a copy. They approve the letter, because I got it written exactly how they want it (that process is a whole other story) and they send me on my way.\n\nHowever, on Maui, they have consistently given me issues. They take my letter in the back and review it for over 20 mins leaving me w no one to talk to. They then say they need to review it w their supervisors and send the letter to someone up top. Honolulu does not to this, their staff are trained to process the letter. They are rude on maui. They tell me I need to not only call but also send in a copy of the letter 48 hrs in advance. This is not possible for people who travel frequently between islands and often book their flight only a fews hrs in advance. Further, sometimes I do not have access to a scanner or fax machine for the couple days I'm on maui. Everytime I'm on maui, the rude staff mention this woman Kristen Foster who apparently makes all these ridiculous rules and makes it a headache for people who travel w pets. I'm not sure why she is involved so much on maui, yet I never hear her name on oahu. I've heard other reviews where she has made life very difficult for people to fly w pets. Honest people, who are trying to follow the rules (which constantly chance) should not be treated this way. It is obvious that hawaiian airlines is trying to discourage people from flying w pets. Further, this ridiculous policy that they have come up w is not mandated by the federal government. I have flown on island air and they happily let my emmotional support dog on the plane w out any documentation and they also didn't even try to charge me. There is no one to talk to at hawaiian airlines about this issue. You are at the mercy of the staff at the check in desk. Even when u get your ducks in a row and follow their procedures, they come up w something else. This complaint is only directed at the staff at maui airport and this woman Kristen foster. Honolulu staff have been nothing but professional and kind. I hope hawaiian airlines looks into the rude behavior and irrational policies coming from the maui staff and Kristen foster.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nCelia\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nNot accomodating Pet\n\n\n\nI was to travel Alaska originally which had electrical problems.

This is why i am writing another review if it keeps anyone else from going what we went through its worth it. My dogs flight from Seattle to Hilo was 16 hours. When i got to Oahu i ended up with a 5 hour wait to go to Hilo I tried to bump my dog to a earlier flight and was told i could. Was told to get a big cart and bring him from agriculture to the counter, after looking for a half hour for the cart only to be told i was that i could not use them, went back to tIcket counter only to have a new employee there who told me i could not bump him up and wanted to know who told me that. I explained that the previous employee told me, she wanted to know the persons name ( i did not know) she then told she me she could not help me but called a supervisor and tha'ts when things went very downhill. I wanted her to try and reach cargo as they were closed on the weekend ( which it was ) she would not and told me my dog was not flying from Oahu to Hilo in baggage because no dogs do. At that time i told her i was booked to Hilo through cargo and she wanted proof, cargo does not give you inter Island paperwork till you arrive at cargo so i had nothing to show her for the second half of the flight to Hilo. I think at this point she thought I was lying as she became rude, and nasty. she told me if i thought my dog was flying cargo than i should go there. I asked her where cargo was and she said at cargo i then again asked her where cargo was and she again nastily said at cargo, i then where is cargo located and she raised her voice and said at cargo. As i was walking away a employee whispered to me its on Elliott st. I then spent then next hour trying find a place to stay for the weekend in Oahu ( since the supervisor told me my dog was not flying and it was the weekend and when you call cargo it said it was closed ) could not find any opening to stay that would take a dog. I then called my husband in Hilo in tears telling him that i was more than likely going to rent a van and spend the weekend in a parking lot with our dog till i could talk to someone at cargo on monday. I then called a taxi and the driver was incredible he could tell i was very distressed and i told him what was happening and he told me dogs fly out of cargo all the time to Hilo and that cargo was open for dogs going out. He also told me that if for some reason they were not open he would help me so i did not have to sleep in a rented van. He also took my dog to a dog park so he could get out of his kennel for a short time. He took me to cargo and they were expecting and waiting for my dog and yes my dog was flying in baggage to Hilo just like I told the supervisor at Hawaiian. I paid $816.00 for my dog to fly from Seattle to Hilo and were abused for that money. Saddest of all was that the Hawaiian supervisor could have reached cargo and it would have been cleared up instead she chose not to help me and on top of it treat me very rudely. I complained to Hawaiian airline and they came back and said it was a misunderstanding and gave me 1000 miles. No apology for the treatment i received from her. we no longer fly Hawaiian. We own property on the big island and now use Alaska Airlines and its only $100 dollars each direction for your pet to fly, it goes in baggage not cargo. They allow you to put you dog on right before the flight, no 3 hours early in cargo ( which is just plain cruel. A vet meets us in Kona and inspects our dogs paperwork and then we drive to Hilo. I do not think Hawaiian should be allowed to fly pets especially when they are unwilling to help you if there is a problem. More than anything i am glad our dog survived, he was so traumatized it was horrifying. i do not want anyone to go through what we went through.It was one of the most traumatizing thing I have been through. I take responsibilty for using Hawaiian cargo and learned a hard lesson from it never again. We even canceled our Hawaiian credit card.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nLila\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nVery Pleased\n\n\n\nOn our move to Hawai with our dogs, Hawaiian was very Helpful. When we boarded we told the flight attendant that we had 2 dogs in cargo. He went to check that they were boarded, then went to check himself. They were under the pilots where the fresh air comes in and they kept the light on for them. When we got them from the animal office -they were ready for release as soon as we landed, got our bags and got to the office. They were very helpful in making our and our dogs flights very comfortable.\n\n\nLoad More Reviews\n\nLoading…\n\nFailed.\n[Post a Review](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/15/review/)![Bubble](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bubble.svg)\n\nPost a Review\n\n\n## Traveler Photos\n\n\nWe haven‘t received any photos of dogs flying Hawaiian Airlines yet.\n\n\n\n\nWant to feature your creature?

However, we had an absolutely AWFUL experience today. Apparently, Hawaiian Airlines had updated their policy to require that dogs flying in-cabin must be able to stand in an upright manner (their heads held at neutral, above-body height) while in their carrier. With a carrier height restriction of a measly 9.5\", this is impossible for most dogs. When we called to reserve a spot for our dogs, we were only told the usual (i.e. carrier and weight limitations, and that dogs must be able to comfortably turn around and lie in their carrier). When we tried to check in with an agent at the guest services counter, she immediately glared at us and told us that she won't allow our dog on the plane. She was completely unsympathetic, unfriendly, and unhelpful. Her only solution was to leave and come back with a hard-sided carrier to throw her in cargo. After debating for some time, we just left and ran into another agent who was able to assist us and was extremely apologetic. Furthermore, the first agent almost denied entry for our tiny 8 pound dog! I completely understand that dogs should not be stuffed into a carrier without any space to move, but their new policy is way too strict. Just be warned that you may be denied entry if you encounter the wrong guest agent!\n\n- [![Summer](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/ZrBJhx36l8/SummerDien.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nSummer\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1582956)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nHawaiian Airlines new pet carrier policy doesn’t make sense\n\n\n\nI flew from Maui OGG to Kauai LIH with my cat and she was taller than 9.5” (which is the max height for the soft sided pet carrier) and they were giving me a hard time because she couldn’t stand in her carrier. But not many cats can with that height restriction. I even had my friend bring a hard carrier for the cargo section but it was still too small. Their policy is obviously do not take into consideration the size of pets. Hawaiian Airlines was not very helpful And just shrugged and told me that rules are rules.

Before this was never a problem, but now with the new requirements I almost got turned away when taking my cat to the vet the other day. The gate agent at Kona was very curt, brought out a tape measure, told me I couldn't bring her in the cabin! I eventually was let onto the plane, but not until after a lot of back-and-forth. If there is a carrier that anyone knows of that fits their requirement for size, PLEASE share!\n\n- [![M](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/CcC2bS29J3/M.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nM\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1444550)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nQuarantine employees in Oahu\n\n\n\nReminded me of DMV employees. Heartless, cold, hating life and definitely hating their jobs. Can’t even look at you when communicating. If you don’t play along with their mood they will complicate things for you. Luckily my wife is skilled at working with entitled people as a hotel front desk agent. She was able to stroke the lady’s egos just enough to get our dogs processed in time. We almost missed our connecting flight to Maui from California because the quarantine employees seemed to have some office drama going on between them. My advice: if going to an outer island be sure to use the direct release program.\n\n- [![Sid](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/F5oCMBZOdC/SidKarpav.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nSid\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1420249)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nBEWARE of new HA in-cabin policy…\n\n\n\nAm at Honolulu (HNL) awaiting return to Kona (KOA), from where we left two days ago. At the Services desk, where one needs to check in with a pet, I was immediately denied because the agent said my 12 pound dog could not comfortably stand in his soft-sided kennel. Mind you, this is a regulation-size soft sided kennel in which he travels to and from Boston on two 6-hr legs usually via Seattle on excellent Alaska Airlines. We make the round trip twice annually and use the very kennel in which he arrived to HNL on a Hawaiian flight 51 hours ago. Speaking of his fellow Kona-based HA agents he said “they were wrong” to allow me to depart Kona, that there were new rules implemented on June 1 and, other than presenting a printed sheet of paper showing Hawaiian’s new policy, was unwilling to assist me. Distressed and nearly furious, I awaited another agent who at least had the good sense to contact a supervisor. About 30 minutes later (!) a supervisor named Wendy approached, apologized for her delay, explained the policy and allowed me to check in. The new policy apparently does not allow a pet whose head would extend above the carrier when unzipped to travel in the cabin. So you might be able to travel with a 5 pound Chihuahua or heavier low-slung dog. If this BringFido site still shows the image of a small, bright-eyed white canine with its head extending through its soft-sided kennel then BEWARE of travel on Hawaiian with any pet similar in size. My little guy is smaller than that and we almost got stranded at HNL, trying only to return home on a 49 minute flight.\n\n- [![Susan](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/895002/asid481959382342968height50width50ext1557607594hashAeTPlxNUUaPpGfZn?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nSusan\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/177529)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nHassled every time in Oahu\n\n\n\nI have traveled many times with my Dogue De Bordeaux as a service dog and know all the rules and paperwork required....Hawaiian Airlines in Kona and Hilo and Seattle are wonderful...every time I have to go through Oahu even on inter’-island they are rude and try to tell me why my dog cannot go on the airplane....inter-island Oahu asked for my paperwork...the only thing they are allowed to ask me is does my dog provide a service and what that is...This time I got right in her face and all of a sudden my dog was allowed through without them needing anything...interesting. Once I came through Seattle to Oahu and on to Kona and here they go again at H.A. Oahu counter. This supervisor had me in tears trying to refuse me because my letter was on the doctor’s prescription pad instead of letterhead...wow, really? Seattle didn’t mind, no one else ever had a problem with it ever....This woman was horrible...another woman at the counter came up to me and said if I just wouldn’t have shown the letter, they would have allowed me through...Really?? Incredible...\n\nI love flying Hawaiian Airlines and will continue to do so now that I know their game in Oahu\n\n- [![Derek](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nDerek\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/105509)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nGreat expirence\n\n\n\nWhile vacationing on Kauai last February we adopted \"Shamu\" our 4 year old black lab... Little did we know when adopting him that nobody would fly him back to Massachusetts for us.... except Hawaiian. We flew Shamu home via cargo and he was just fine!\n\n\n\nThe Humane Society was incredibly helpful in ensuring that we had all the correct paperwork for Shamu - but made one small mistake on his medical sheet. It wasn't a huge problem they quickly drew us up a new one and we ran over to get it (Only a few miles away).\n\n\n\nIf you make sure you get to your flight early and you have the proper paperwork easy peasy!\n\n\n\nI attached a nice little letter introducing himself to the airline staff and a little bag of candy for them as well. They treated our boy with much aloha and he had a great flight home.\n\n\n\nThe only caution I will give is if you are flying your dog into a cold climate... BEWARE! You MUST watch the weather reports like a hawk or your dog may not fly.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nHikari\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nNot Pet Friendly\n\n\n\nFiled a federal complaint against Hawaiian. I flew 3 different carriers with my pet and Hawaiian, the 4th carrier gave me the MOST problems. I checked in 3 hours before my flight from San Diego to Honolulu and they made me wait 2 hours while they went to process authorization. They then said they would make an exception and let me fly. I should have made them not make the exception as the Federal complaint was excused because the airline did allow me to fly. Big deal, they just got away with discrimination and will continue to do this over and over again. I guess they truly don't want to accept pets and if so, them they should just NOT do it.\n\n\n\nAlso, it is NOT Hawaii Quarrantine that doesn't allow the pets in the cabin as many are told. It is the AIRLINES who are refusing to allow the pets in cabin into Hawaii. Kudos to ALASKA AIR.

I have tried very hard to speak with their public relations/customer service people at corporate to try to change this, but they absolutely will not respond. The people you get on the phone when you call their 800 number simply say it is \"Hawaii State Law\". I tried to explain to them that the Hawaii State Department of Agriculture told me directly that is not true. Although, you must go through a tremendous amount of red tape, the requirement to place the dogs in cargo coming into Hawaii is Hawaiian Airlines rule, not the state's. Alaska Airlines does allow small dogs to fly in the cabin with you coming into Hawaii. I hate to change Airlines, but my babies are too important to put through that kind of trauma.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nCheryl West\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nTerrified\n\n\n\nAfter the tremendous amount of paperwork Hawaii requires to bring your dog you would certainly expect Hawaiian Aire to accommodate travelers with their beloved pets.

I purchased a Noa pass which allows me 60 segments for the same price at anytime. I rarely know exactly when I fly and purchased the pass so I didn't have to deal w chance fees or hikes in last minute prices. I usually book my ticket 3 or 4 hrs prior to leaving.\n\nFlying w my dog is not a problem leaving honolulu. I usually call in to notify them I will be flying w her the moment I get my ticket. At the counter in honolulu, they follow procedure and do the checklist for my letter. I also make a copy for them so they don't have to go in the back to make a copy. They approve the letter, because I got it written exactly how they want it (that process is a whole other story) and they send me on my way.\n\nHowever, on Maui, they have consistently given me issues. They take my letter in the back and review it for over 20 mins leaving me w no one to talk to. They then say they need to review it w their supervisors and send the letter to someone up top. Honolulu does not to this, their staff are trained to process the letter. They are rude on maui. They tell me I need to not only call but also send in a copy of the letter 48 hrs in advance. This is not possible for people who travel frequently between islands and often book their flight only a fews hrs in advance. Further, sometimes I do not have access to a scanner or fax machine for the couple days I'm on maui. Everytime I'm on maui, the rude staff mention this woman Kristen Foster who apparently makes all these ridiculous rules and makes it a headache for people who travel w pets. I'm not sure why she is involved so much on maui, yet I never hear her name on oahu. I've heard other reviews where she has made life very difficult for people to fly w pets. Honest people, who are trying to follow the rules (which constantly chance) should not be treated this way. It is obvious that hawaiian airlines is trying to discourage people from flying w pets. Further, this ridiculous policy that they have come up w is not mandated by the federal government. I have flown on island air and they happily let my emmotional support dog on the plane w out any documentation and they also didn't even try to charge me. There is no one to talk to at hawaiian airlines about this issue. You are at the mercy of the staff at the check in desk. Even when u get your ducks in a row and follow their procedures, they come up w something else. This complaint is only directed at the staff at maui airport and this woman Kristen foster. Honolulu staff have been nothing but professional and kind. I hope hawaiian airlines looks into the rude behavior and irrational policies coming from the maui staff and Kristen foster.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nCelia\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nNot accomodating Pet\n\n\n\nI was to travel Alaska originally which had electrical problems. They purchased a ticket on Hawwaiian to accommodate me with my 4 lb chuahua. I was attempting to make my schedule with quarantine on a direct release from Las Vegas to Kahului HI. After I ran clear to the other end of the terminal the representatives would not let me on w/o a certificate from my Dr. stating I had special needs/assistance. in order for Zorro to ride in the cabin with me. I'm not impressed now that I read there policy and it states he could have flown with a $175 charge. Instead I ran back to Alaska which was great in the end. My poor dog was stuck in his kennel w/o bathroom from 4:45 AM LV time to 11:30 PM LV time when we arrived in Kahalui 8:30 PM. It just wasn't right.\n\nI showed all my paperwork for the 5 day or direct release program which should have sufficed.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nmike richards\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nHappy, happy ,happy\n\n\n\nI found the Hawaiian Airlines employees to be very friendly and helpful , I shipped my 106 lb. bull mastiff thru their cargo dept. from Seattle to Honolulu.

This is why i am writing another review if it keeps anyone else from going what we went through its worth it. My dogs flight from Seattle to Hilo was 16 hours. When i got to Oahu i ended up with a 5 hour wait to go to Hilo I tried to bump my dog to a earlier flight and was told i could. Was told to get a big cart and bring him from agriculture to the counter, after looking for a half hour for the cart only to be told i was that i could not use them, went back to tIcket counter only to have a new employee there who told me i could not bump him up and wanted to know who told me that. I explained that the previous employee told me, she wanted to know the persons name ( i did not know) she then told she me she could not help me but called a supervisor and tha'ts when things went very downhill. I wanted her to try and reach cargo as they were closed on the weekend ( which it was ) she would not and told me my dog was not flying from Oahu to Hilo in baggage because no dogs do. At that time i told her i was booked to Hilo through cargo and she wanted proof, cargo does not give you inter Island paperwork till you arrive at cargo so i had nothing to show her for the second half of the flight to Hilo. I think at this point she thought I was lying as she became rude, and nasty. she told me if i thought my dog was flying cargo than i should go there. I asked her where cargo was and she said at cargo i then again asked her where cargo was and she again nastily said at cargo, i then where is cargo located and she raised her voice and said at cargo. As i was walking away a employee whispered to me its on Elliott st. I then spent then next hour trying find a place to stay for the weekend in Oahu ( since the supervisor told me my dog was not flying and it was the weekend and when you call cargo it said it was closed ) could not find any opening to stay that would take a dog. I then called my husband in Hilo in tears telling him that i was more than likely going to rent a van and spend the weekend in a parking lot with our dog till i could talk to someone at cargo on monday. I then called a taxi and the driver was incredible he could tell i was very distressed and i told him what was happening and he told me dogs fly out of cargo all the time to Hilo and that cargo was open for dogs going out. He also told me that if for some reason they were not open he would help me so i did not have to sleep in a rented van. He also took my dog to a dog park so he could get out of his kennel for a short time. He took me to cargo and they were expecting and waiting for my dog and yes my dog was flying in baggage to Hilo just like I told the supervisor at Hawaiian. I paid $816.00 for my dog to fly from Seattle to Hilo and were abused for that money. Saddest of all was that the Hawaiian supervisor could have reached cargo and it would have been cleared up instead she chose not to help me and on top of it treat me very rudely. I complained to Hawaiian airline and they came back and said it was a misunderstanding and gave me 1000 miles. No apology for the treatment i received from her. we no longer fly Hawaiian. We own property on the big island and now use Alaska Airlines and its only $100 dollars each direction for your pet to fly, it goes in baggage not cargo. They allow you to put you dog on right before the flight, no 3 hours early in cargo ( which is just plain cruel. A vet meets us in Kona and inspects our dogs paperwork and then we drive to Hilo. I do not think Hawaiian should be allowed to fly pets especially when they are unwilling to help you if there is a problem. More than anything i am glad our dog survived, he was so traumatized it was horrifying. i do not want anyone to go through what we went through.It was one of the most traumatizing thing I have been through. I take responsibilty for using Hawaiian cargo and learned a hard lesson from it never again. We even canceled our Hawaiian credit card.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nLila\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nVery Pleased\n\n\n\nOn our move to Hawai with our dogs, Hawaiian was very Helpful.

When we got them from the animal office -they were ready for release as soon as we landed, got our bags and got to the office. They were very helpful in making our and our dogs flights very comfortable.\n\n\nLoad More Reviews\n\nLoading…\n\nFailed.\n[Post a Review](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/15/review/)![Bubble](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bubble.svg)\n\nPost a Review\n\n\n## Traveler Photos\n\n\nWe haven‘t received any photos of dogs flying Hawaiian Airlines yet.\n\n\n\n\nWant to feature your creature?

    "markdown": "# International Pet Travel\n\nMany countries have strict regulations regarding international pet travel. You’ll find an overview of bringing Fido to many popular international destinations below. No matter where you’re going, you should contact the embassy or consulate of the destination country to confirm pet travel regulations, obtain all of the necessary paperwork (such as health certificates and documentation) regarding your pet’s travel, and contact your local veterinarian to ensure your pet is in compliance with foreign health regulations.\n\n\n\nFinally, don’t forget to check regulations on bringing Fido back to your home country too. Quarantine rules may apply even if your dog has only been gone a short time. Have more questions about crossing the pond with your pooch?

To bring your cat or dog with you, you’ll pay a fee of EUR 75 to EUR 400 per one-way.\n\n## Pets in Cargo\n\nPets that exceed the maximum weight for traveling in the hold, those traveling alone, or animals that are heading to countries where they require pets to be transported as freight, can all go through Air France-KLM Cargo instead, where animals are shipped with a special cargo agent. Pets and carriers weighing more than 165 lbs (75 kg) or exceeding 115\" (292 cm) in height must travel this way. On some types of aircraft, the kennel must not be larger than 97\" (247 cm). You can contact them directly at 800-556-9000 to find out prices, availability, and conditions for your pet's travel plans.\n\n## Carrier Guidelines\n\nFor animals traveling in the cabin, carriers must be soft-sided and no bigger than 18\" x 11\" x 9\" (46 cm x 28 cm x 24 cm). Pets must be able to stand up and lay down comfortably inside. For pets traveling in the hold, carriers must not exceed the dimensions of 48\" x 32\" x 35\" (122 cm x 81 cm x 89 cm) on KLM flights and 40\" x 27\" x 30\" (102 cm x 69 cm x 76 cm) on KLM Cityhopper flights. Carriers must alsohave a fiberglass or rigid plastic shell, wheels must be removed or blocked with duct tape, the door must have a centralized locking system, and the two parts of the carrier must be joined by bolts. It must be large enough for your pet to stand up without touching the top, turn around easily, and lie down in a natural position.\n\n## Other Restrictions\n\nUnfortunately, snub-nosed breeds are not allowed to travel with KLM. Animals of this type must be transported via KLM Cargo. The following dog breeds are not accepted for travel with KLM: Affenpinscher, American Bully, Boston Terrier, Boxers (all breeds), Bulldogs (all breeds), Bull Mastiff, Cane Corso, Pugs (all breeds), Chow-Chow, Great Dane (all breeds), Certain breeds of Spaniel (Tibetan, Japanese, English, King Charles), Brussels Griffon, Lhasa Apso, Mastiffs (all breeds), Neapolitan Mastiff, Pekingese, Small Brabant, Shih Tzu, Shar Pei, Staffordshire Bull Terrier. The following cat breeds are not permitted: Burmese, Exotic Shorthair, Himalayan, and Persian.\n\n## Reviews\n\nBringFido Guest Rating\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKLM Royal Dutch Airlines has received a rating of 4.0 out of 5 bones by 0 canine critics on BringFido.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/loading.svg)\n\nLoading reviews…\n\nUnable to load.\n\n\n- [![Nele](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/URwVloSPcR/asid10200541726205621height50width50ext1636386933hashAeT8IvGRdaILBIYeRpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nNele\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/847841)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nGreat experience, kind staff\n\n\n\nI flew with my cat in the cabin from Netherlands to Spain.

When I arrived to Mexico I was surprised to see that the kennel of my dog was replaced by a bigger one, to make her feel more comfortable.

    "markdown": "# Ten Tips for Flying with Fido\n\n\n\n\nTaking his first flight can be a somewhat traumatic experience for a dog that’s used to sticking his head out the car window and enjoying the sights along the way. After all, his view just won’t be the same from underneath the seat in front of you, or even worse, from the cargo hold. But getting there can still be half the fun if you follow the ten tips below and make sure you’re familiar with the [Airline Pet Policy](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/), restrictions on [Pet Travel in the US](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/us_regulations/), and any additional [International Pet Travel](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/international/) restrictions at your destination.\n\n\n## 1\\. Book early\n\nMost airlines only allow one or two dogs on each flight, so it’s important to book your dog’s ticket as soon as possible. Don’t buy your ticket until you call the airline and make sure there is a “seat” available for your dog on the flight. Once the agent has confirmed availability, reserve both your seats on the same ticket while you’re still on the phone with the agent.\n\n\n## 2\\. Fly direct\n\nBook a non-stop, direct flight whenever possible and try to fly on a weekday when airports are typically less hectic. If your pet will be traveling in the cargo hold, it’s best to fly in the morning or evening during the summer, and midday during the winter to avoid extremely hot or cold temperatures.\n\n\n## 3\\. Visit the veterinarian\n\nMake an appointment with your pet’s veterinarian for a check-up and make sure all vaccinations are up to date. Obtain a health certificate from your veterinarian dated within 10 days of departure. For travel outside the continental United States, additional planning and health care requirements may be necessary. Visit our International Pet Travel or contact the foreign office of the country you are traveling to for more information.\n\n\n## 4\\. Buy a carrier\n\nWhether your dog is a Chihuahua or a Great Dane, there’s a pet carrier to match. Carriers are available in both hard-sided and soft-sided. Soft-sided carriers are more suitable for carry-on and tend to fit better under the seat, but they’re only permitted in the cabin only. To make sure the carrier will fit under the seat on your flight check the size restrictions of the airline in our Airline Pet Policies section. If your dog will be traveling in the cargo hold, purchase a hard plastic carrier with holes for ventilation instead. Carriers must be big enough for your dog to stand, turn around, and lie down comfortably. If the carrier does not permit him to do this, the airline will refuse transport.\n\n\n## 5\\. Can I see some ID, ma’am?\n\nAfter you’ve purchased an appropriate carrier, write your dog’s name on it and include identification tags with your home address and phone number as well as the address and phone number of someone who can be reached at your destination. Carry a current photograph of your pet as well. If he’s lost during the trip, a photograph will make it much easier for airline employees or the local authorities to search effectively. You might also want to consider a permanent form of id (such as a microchip or tattoo) that will increase the likelihood of reuniting with your dog if he gets lost on the trip.\n\n\n## 6\\. Take a test drive\n\nAnimals travel under less stress when they are accustomed to their carrier before they travel. In the weeks prior to your trip, put your dog in his carrier as often as possible for trips around town.\n\n\n## 7\\. Eat, drink, poop, then play\n\nSince a full stomach might be uncomfortable for your dog during travel, we recommend feeding him about four hours before the flight, if possible. While it’s best to refrain from feeding your dog right before the flight, you can (and should) continue to give him water right up to the time of travel. Just be sure to empty the dish before checking in so it doesn’t spill during the flight. If you’re checking the dog, leave the dishes in the carrier so an airline employee can provide your pet with food and water in the event of an extended delay before or after your flight. You should also exercise your pet and let him use the facilities (i.e. grass) before heading to the airport.\n\n\n## 8\\. Arrive early\n\nArrive at the airport early, but not too early, and have your dog’s health certificate handy. You will not be allowed to check your pet in more than four hours before the flight. Most airlines recommend arriving two hours before your flight when traveling with a pet. Passengers with pets must check-in at the counter; curbside and self service check-in are not allowed.\n\n\n## 9\\. -Don’t- take a Valium\n\nWe don’t mind if you take a Valium before the flight, but don’t give your pet tranquilizers just because you’re nervous. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, in most cases, dogs should not be given sedatives or tranquilizers prior to flying because they can create respiratory and cardiovascular problems as the dog is exposed to increased altitude pressures. They can also alter the animal’s natural ability to balance and maintain equilibrium, which can be dangerous when the carrier is moved. While sedation is generally not advised, the decision on whether or not to prescribe a tranquilizer for your pet should be made by your veterinarian. If he or she decides that tranquilizers are medically necessary for the trip, indicate the name of the drug taken and the dosage on the dog’s carrier.\n\n\n## 10\\. You’ve arrived!\n\nWhen you arrive at your destination, go for a long walk before you check in at the hotel. Your dog will feel more comfortable as soon as he sees (and smells) his new surroundings, and realizes that the same rules and boundaries apply here too. By the time you check into the hotel, your dog will already feel right and home and be ready for whatever adventures are in store for him that week.\n\n\n* * *\n\n## Packing List\n\nDon’t forget these items when packing your dog’s suitcase:\n\n\n- Health certificate and medical records\n- Contact information for your regular veterinarian and an emergency contact at your destination\n- Comb, brush, and flea control products\n- Any special medication your dog might need\n- Spare collar with id tag\n- Pet wipes or grooming products\n- Paper towels and stain remover\n- Enough dog food and treats for the entire trip\n- Plenty of bottled water (a sudden change can upset your dog’s stomach)\n- Food and water dishes\n- Leash and poop bags\n- Your dog’s favorite toy and blanket\n- A list of [dog friendly restaurants](https://www.bringfido.com/restaurant/) and [attractions](https://www.bringfido.com/attraction/) at your destination\n\n\nYour Privacy\n\n\nWe use cookies to deliver our services, personalize content, and get feedback on how people use BringFido so that we can improve.\nBy clicking OK, you accept this as outlined in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.bringfido.com/privacy/#cookies).\n\n\nOK\n\n[iframe](https://www.bringfido.com/google/onetap/)",

Depends on Check in Agent. Unsure whether to continue.\n\n\n\nWe have been flying with our 16 pound non-shedding, quiet Havanese for 7 years with Southwest, with the same Sturdibag carrier that can flex and that he fits into easily. It fits under all seats. Most of the time it is not an issue. Flying back out of IAD the past few years, we get hassled each time about the size of the carrier and the fact that he cannot stand in it. The only dog that could stand in a carrier under Southwest's bag restrictions would be a very short Yorkie. Most CATS couldn't even meet that height limitation, and I'd love to see them try to get a cat to stand and turn on command. I'm pretty sure they don't make cats take that test, because it's stressful, and, well, cats. I don't think they'd allow a dachshund, because they'd argue it couldn't turn around easily. I'm a little concerned about the recent comments about DEN. I hate making long drives, but we have to reconsider if the airlines keep giving us a hard time.\n\n- [![Elisabeth](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nElisabeth\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1441600)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nSouthwest Airlines in Denver\n\n\n\nIf I could give 0 bones for Southwest in Denver, I would. We have flown with my dogs 8 times without any problems, but this when I tried to fly out of Denver to CA, the Southwest Agent wouldn't let my husband and I fly with one of our dogs because he couldn't stand up and turn around in his carrier. It was the SAME carrier we had used the past 8 times! We told the Southwest Agent and her stupid Southwest Manager this, but they didn't care. The Manager asked if we could leave our dog with someone. We were checking in for a flight!!! Who would we ask to take care of our dog and pick him up from the Denver Airport?!! Our dog is 20 pounds with longer legs, but can lay down comfortably in the carrier. The spaces under the Southwest seats are small. What dog over 10 pounds can stand and turn around in their carrier when they are put under the seat!!! We had our dogs in a dog stroller while in the Denver Airport, which the Southwest Agent saw, and we don't put our dogs in their carrier until we board the plane. We ended up having to drive to CA. By the way, we were stuck at Denver Airport for 14 hours on Christmas 2022 because of the Southwest Airlines fiasco and we had our 2 dogs with us. Southwest didn't seem to care about our welfare let alone are dogs' welfare! We ended up missing Christmas with my family and again, we had to drive to CA. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me or should I say, fly on Southwest and get crapped on, shame on them, fly on Southwest again and get crapped a 2nd time, time to throw out the shovel and use a better airline!!!!\n\n- [![Jacs](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nJacs\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1200583)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nSpace under seat smaller than usual\n\n\n\nFlown with my dog countless times, always in the same carrier. This time the space under the seat had some plastic attachments that would not fit the carrier. Staff were extremely rude and made us smash the carrier in (with our dog in it that just had surgery). Never flying southwest again.\n\n- [![Jen](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nJen\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1193844)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nBe prepared to be STRANDED.\n\n\n\nThis is our first time flying with Southwest into Denver, Colorado from Dallas, Texas with our 20lbs Corgi. She flew in successfully from the Dallas location and the carrier fit great with us in the cabin. Heading back home to Dallas from Denver, they DENIED her check-in. They had stated she wouldn't be allowed to fly due to her size, even though she flew in with them. We were left STRANDED at their airport with no liabilities on their end and their sister location. They had no cargo and simply offered nothing but that \"they care about her wellbeing\" even though she flew in from their Dallas location with no apologies. Then they proceeded to pet our pup without our permission and asked if we wanted to still travel with them, knowing she wouldn't be able to travel back with us. WTF is that. Firstly, we wouldn't have traveled at all if our Corgi was denied beforehand. But the fact that she was accepted and now left stranded DUE TO THEIR ERRORS made it all a terrible experience. Never again.\n\n- [![Vanessa](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nVanessa\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/954932)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nI suspect it \\*completely\\* depends on the crew.\n\n\n\nOur pup is our only child. We have flown on SWA with him 3 times. I thoroughly reviewed the rules and was aware before traveling what was expected of me and my pup Grissom. We practiced from the time he was 12 weeks old sitting in the travel bag, he knows the drill. While Grissom did fine on the first two flights, the third flight left him a bit anxious (very likely due to my own stress levels). He began whimpering and scratching at mesh window in the bag. I unzipped it just enough to get my fingers into the bag so I could pet him, give him a treat and try to calm him. I was quickly scolded and told to zip the bag up COMPLETELY for the remainder of the flight. This only added to my stress level. My pup is whimpering and begging to poke his head out, and I am forced to sit silently and watch the miles and minutes tick by. It was heartbreaking. I won't do it again. I am so disappointed. I would be happy to pay for a first class ticket on any airline that would accommodate my child. I would gladly pay for a seat for my pup just to be allowed to keep him in a bag on a seat next to me. It saddens me that some flight crews fail to acknowledge that there are families, like mine, whose only child happens to be a pup and stuffing them under the seat and ignoring them like they're an inanimate object for a prolonged period just doesn't make one bit of sense. I live for the day when I can buy row of 3 seats for myself, my husband and our pup and fly comfortably, just as we do in a vehicle. Unfortunately, until then, it looks like we'll be driving.\n\n- [![Celeste](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/XDTdlvARRl/CelesteVillanueva.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nCeleste\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/637146)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nHere's the skinny on pet carrier size on SWA\n\n\n\nI stumbled upon this website because I freaked out when I saw the pet carrier dimensions on SWA's website. Based on the majority of comments on this site stating the SWA pet carrier bottom is not sturdy enough, I got a small pet carrier. Luckily my puppy was 5.75 lbs. He fit ok, couldn't stand completely upright, but he could sit up right and had enough room to make himself comfortable. I originally bought the medium but didn't think it'd fit under the seat. I flew from Chicago to Tucson round trip. Google states SWA has a fleet of 737-800 and 737 MAX 8, and some older 737-700. I know I came back in a 737-800, and think I flew out in the same. Ok, getting to the point, the small carrier had more than enough room to fit under the seat in front of me. There was an additional 1\"-1.5\" of space above the carrier and roughly 2\" of space to the left and right of the carrier. I was able to slide my Coach shoulder bag (close to the size of a tote) next to the carrier. The medium could have easily fit. Additionally, the SWA team at MDW and TUS were so sweet to my puppy. I will say I Googled the heck out of traveling with a pet on a plane since this was my first time with a puppy I had for less than a week. I did the following: called SWA and they noted I was flying with a puppy, took early morning flights, got my puppy up an hour earlier than I'd typically get up for an early morning flight, played with him and gave him an extra potty break. Went on both airport websites and screen shot the locations of the pet relief areas, since I always check my carry-on no issues going to the counter to pay the $95 pet travel fee. You can't do it online or over the phone. In Chicago I stayed in the area 30min before the doors closed, I was Group C so what did I care. On the way back I paid for early bird check-in and kept him up until 11pm and woke him up at 5am. The morning of, he got a snack and as much water as he wanted. I gave him more snacks at the pet relief areas and offered water. I followed airport/SWA rules and only let him out of his carrier at security and the pet relief areas. He slept both ways. People around me were surprised a puppy was on board. I put the small and medium side by side, about 1.5\" taller in height, 1\" more in width, 2\" more in length. I know they have dimensions online but those are my visual measurements. I stressed way more than I needed. SWA made it stress free, and this is during a pandemic. So that's saying something.\n\n- [![Y](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nY\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/155276)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nTicketing staff is clueless regarding ESA. Ripped me off and will not fly again with Southwest\n\n\n\nI purchased the most expensive ticket to receive the highest priority boarding because the customer service team recommended me if I wanted to sit in the front row for more space for my ESA.\n\n\n\nOnce boarded, a stewardess told me I am not allowed to sit in the front row because I have a dog!!! I told the ticketing staff told me to do and the whole story. She did not accept me on the first row. While discussing, others were boarding. When I was rejected, only the seat available was a middle seat in the 3-3 airplane. My dog was extremely uncomfortable, and I also felt bad for the others in the same row for 5.5 hours.\n\n\n\nThey ripped me off for at least $400 for the expensive ticket for the priority boarding ticket and we ended up in a middle seat. Will never fly with Southwest again. Wish I flew with Delta or United in a business class with the same money.\n\n- [![Vicki](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nVicki\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/482856)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nGreat Experience\n\n\n\nI flew to pick up a puppy in Denver and make return trip to Orlando.

They told me that I need a legitimate ESA letter from a doctor or therapist and that my dog would not be able to fly with me until I had one. I was pissed at first because I paid money to register my ESA dog online, but their registration was worthless and I couldn't fly that day.\n\n\n\nI got my ESA letter from a legitimate site and not some bogus registration site and Southwest has been nothing but kind and accepting of me and my ESA dog.

He's quiet and fits well under the seat. The bag we carried him in was a bit oversized but was flexible and 'flattened' a bit to fit perfectly under the seat. However, one day I showed up at the airport to return to my house up north and was called to the counter (after having gone through security) and told I could not take the dog because someone had an allergy. They did have to allow one service dog that was there but no other dogs booked on that flight could go. (The person with the allergy still flew with the service dog so I'm not sure how concerned that person was about their allergy.) Lucky for us we had a house I could return to that night (there were no other flights that day) but they didn't refund me anything and all I got was a complementary pre-boarding pass.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\npat\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\ndogs in cabin\n\n\n\nno problem with dogs, but all I read says they must be in carrier.

Most, including travelers sitting next to us, on the plane are not aware that my pooch is on the plane ( His crate looks like luggage.). I pay the fares, I take care of my dog's elimination requirements and give him a strenuous walk instead of sedation to keep him sleeping. I have had no complaints. My dog has severe flea allergies, I keep him treated for this, but just one flea would set off weeks of intense scratching and skin infections. Boarding him is out of the question for me, and finding someone to dog sit is extremely difficult and expensive where I live.

The woman and her dog were in the front seat section. The dog traveled outside of a carrier and with only a leash. It slept on the floor for most of the flight. Nothing about this situation was in accordance with Southwest and it sure made me wonder if anyone can do this! I have a lab retriever. It would be cheaper for her to fly with me than to board her at a kennel!\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nJoseph\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nRude Agent\n\n\n\n10lb, 10\" tall dog that loves to travel in the car in his airline approved travel bag, very comfortably can stand and turn around etc. however he is just 1 year old and had only flown once before. At the gate the agent checking our luggage for a 4 hour flight, with a one hour stop, was fine with everything. The agent next to her standing there with nothing to do decided to stick her nose in and wanted him to stand up, turn around and do tricks like a circus animal. Got the dog all upset, my wife all upset for no apparent reason. She was extremely rude about the whole thing. It was terrible. Told us Southwest cares about their animals as if we don't care about the comfort of our own dog. The agent taking care of us told her the dog was fine! A bunch of nonsense. Flying is stressful enough with a pet, who needs that? The remainder of the trip was fine but of course the bad start really stays with you. I'm afraid to see what will happen on the trip home.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nHogan Bennett\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nFrequent flier\n\n\n\nI was saying that we have never had any problems with space or sitting.

Pets are welcome to travel in the cabin and as checked bag with Turkish Airlines.\n\n\n[Visit Website](https://www.turkishairlines.com/en-us/any-questions/traveling-with-pets/)\n\n\nOr call [(800) 874-8875](tel:+18008748875) for more information.\n\n\nYou can use BringFido to find a [pet friendly place to stay](https://www.bringfido.com/lodging/) at your destination.\n\n\n## Pets in the Cabin\n\nDogs, cats, and small birds (budgies and canaries) can travel in the cabin with Turkish Airlines, as long as the combined weight of the pet and carrier doesn't exceed 17 lbs (8 kg). Dogs and cats, and cats and birds, are not permitted on the same plane. Pets who share a carrier must be of the same species and cannot exceed the required weight limit and carrier size. A maximum of 2 carriers are allowed per passenger, but only 1 is permitted in the cabin. Fees for pets traveling in the cabin on domestic flights start at $15. Fees for pets traveling in the cabin on international flights start at $70.\n\n## Pets in Checked Baggage\n\nPets who exceed the weight limits to travel in the cabin may qualify for travel as checked baggage instead. Fees for pets traveling as checked baggage on domestic flights start at $21. Fees for pets traveling as checked baggage on international flights start at $120.\n\n## Carrier Guidelines\n\nFor pets traveling in the cabin, carriers must be hard-sided carriers/bags or specially manufactured soft-sided cages/bags and must not exceed the dimensions 23 cm x 30 cm x 40 cm (9\"H x 11\"W x 15\"L). For pets traveling in the hold, carriers must be hard-sided, properly ventilated, watertight and must not exceed 75 cm x 75 cm x 125 cm (30\"H x 30\"W x 50\"L). All carriers must be labeled with the passenger's name, address, telephone number, and the name of the pet(s).\n\n## Other Restrictions\n\nThe following breeds are not permitted to fly in the cabin or as checked baggage with Turkish Airlines: American Bulldog, Bandog Tosa Inu, Caucasian Ovcharka, Dogue de Bordeaux, Doberman (Pincher Doberman and all Doberman breeds), Presa Canario, Rottweiler, Mastiff (except Bull Mastiff), Wolf Dog Mixed-Breeds, Anatolian Shepherd, Boerboel breeds and crossbreeds. However, these breeds may be accepted for travel with Turkish Cargo. Pilots make the final decision on whether pets can travel. If ventilation conditions are insufficient, animals will not be allowed to travel as checked baggage. Pets cannot be transported on Turkish Airlines flights that have final destinations in the UK, including connecting flights.\n\n## Reviews\n\nBringFido Guest Rating\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurkish Airlines has received a rating of 2.1 out of 5 bones by 8 canine critics on BringFido.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nTravelers generally express dissatisfaction with Turkish Airlines' pet policies and customer service, reporting difficulties booking pet travel, unexpected fees, and inconsistent information from staff.

An employee held us up for 1 hour and 40 minutes, putting up every possible obstacle. I had all the correct documentation for the dogs and he asked for a document that was not required on the company website (a veterinary certificate translated into the language of the destination country - I already had it in Vietnamese and English, and in my country they do not ask for this in the local language). When I questioned the lack of this information on the website, he told me that I should go to the airport and speak to him when I purchased the ticket, because there is internal information that only employees have access to and this specific document was one of them. I had already purchased seats next to each other for my family, I paid extra for this and this employee rebooked the seats, placing my family 5 rows apart and said that it was company policy when passengers travel with dogs. If the company is pet friendly, it has a duty to train its employees so that they do not instill in passengers a repulsion towards animals.\n\n- [![Karen](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/FLhQZSn2z7/KarenJane.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nKaren\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1501296)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nWORST AIRLINES EVER!\n\n\n\nI was told to book a ticket in advance of being able to book our pet on the flight.

Within minutes of getting off the phone, we received an email to advise that our pet could not be added to the booking. I rang back and was advised that low an behold, it was not possible to take our pet on that flight. I asked when it would be possible, she advised that it would not be possible for a few days after we were planning to fly, but it may be possible on the Monday, however, she could not confirm until we tried. It was going to cost EUR 200 plus to change our flight booking, without any guarantee that our pet would then be allowed on that flight. In the end I have asked them to cancel the booking. I am unsure if we will receive a full refund, they were also unable to confirm this. We are currently waiting to receive the refund. We will never use this airline again for flying with our pet! There is just no guarantee that your pet will be able to travel with you until after you have booked, and at this point it costs money to change the flight (and possibly to cancel- TBC).\n\n- [![Tatjana](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/oRnwLpqgoe/C78AD620-AA6C-403C-BB7B-E620904C56C7.jpeg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nTatjana\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/925589)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nWould give ZERO stars if possible\n\n\n\nThe absolute WORST airline for pet travel / service dogs.\n\n\n\nI emailed all necessary forms, called them a million times, contacted them via their website contact form, messaged them on Facebook.\n\n\n\nI have a service dog, not emotional support.

They then tried to charge me £300 cancellation fee. I am still disputing it with them and they are reviewing my complaint. I have spoken to 6 people over 4 calls, and no one seems to know their pet policies or they just give wrong information. One person actually hung up on me.

The flight crew has been always very pet friendly and accomodating. You must receive approval for the pets you plan to travel with by calling Turkish Airlines call center and the call center registers your pet to your flight. Unfortunately you cannot add your pet to your flight online. Since the number of pets allowed for in-cabin traveling is limited, I would recommend to contact the call center before you book your flight. The airline asks for your dog's health certificate while you check-in for your flight and they make a copy for their own records. As mentioned at the very beginning of this review, we highly recommend Turkish Airlines for stress-free traveling with your dog in-cabin. We didn't have any experience with dogs traveled in the cargo department , hence cannot comment on that.\n\n\nLoad More Reviews\n\nLoading…\n\nFailed.\n[Post a Review](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/24/review/)![Bubble](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bubble.svg)\n\nPost a Review\n\n\n## Traveler Photos\n\n\nWe dug up a picture of a dog flying Turkish Airlines.\n\n\n\n![Miss Bella the Pomchi_Turkish Airlines in-cabin flight from Istanbul to Boston](https://photos.bringfido.com/photo/2018/11/20/photo/2018/11/20/Miss_Bella_the_Pomchi___THY_picture.JPG?size=block219&density=2x)\n\n\nWant to feature your creature?

Additionally, dogs must appear healthy upon arrival, have a microchip detectable by a universal scanner that was implanted prior to the rabies vaccine, and be at least 6 months old at the time of entry to the U.S. Their microchip number must be included on all required forms and supporting documents. The required forms can be obtained at this [link](https://www.cdc.gov/importation/dogs/us-vaccinated-high-risk-countries.html). For further guidance on returning to the U.S. with your pet from a high-risk country, contact the CDC directly at cdcanimalimports@cdc.gov\n- Dogs are not generally allowed to be imported to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia except for hunting, guarding and guides for the disabled. Dangerous and aggressive dogs, such as Rottweilers, Pit Bulls, Boxers, Mastiffs, Tosas, Bulldogs and Perro de Presa Canarios, are not permitted entry into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia under any circumstances.\n- Animals must be microchipped and accompanied by a KSA import permit from the Saudi Ministry of Agriculture, an endorsed health certificate, and a certificate of origin that must be obtained prior to travel.\n- The USDA APHIS-endorsed veterinary health certificate must state that your pet was examined, vaccinated for all possible diseases, and is healthy overall. The health certificate and certificate of origin must accompany your dog during travel.\n- Travelers with pets may incur a fee for document processing.\n\n## Quarantine Information\n\n\nPets traveling to Saudi Arabia do not need to be quarantined if they meet all the necessary requirements listed above.\n\n\n\n## Download Entry Application\n\nTo download the application form required for entry into Saudi Arabia with a domestic pet, please click the .pdf icon below.\n\n\n[Application](https://media.bringfido.com/travel/country_regulations/SaudiArabia_HealthCert24.pdf)\n\n## Questions & Answers\n\nBe the first to ask a question about this country.\n\n\n[![Bubble](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bubble.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nAsk a Question](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/international/saudi_arabia/?currency=JPY)\n\n* * *\n\n[Suggest an Edit](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/international/82/suggestion/)\n\nYour Privacy\n\n\nWe use cookies to deliver our services, personalize content, and get feedback on how people use BringFido so that we can improve.\nBy clicking OK, you accept this as outlined in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.bringfido.com/privacy/#cookies).\n\n\nOK\n\n[iframe](https://www.bringfido.com/google/onetap/)",

They allow up to six falcons in the economy section of the cabin of aircrafts, with one per passenger.\n\n\n[Visit Website](https://www.qatarairways.com/en/baggage/animals.html)\n\n\nOr call [(877) 777-2827](tel:+18777772827) for more information.\n\n\nYou can use BringFido to find a [pet friendly place to stay](https://www.bringfido.com/lodging/) at your destination.\n\n\n## Pets in the Cabin\n\nQatar Airways allows you to carry 1 falcon in the economy class cabin of an aircraft (a maximum of 6 falcons are permitted on each aircraft and country regulations may apply), but dogs and cats are not permitted in the cabin.\n\n## Pets in Checked Baggage\n\nQatar Airways accepts domesticated dogs, cats, and birds as checked baggage, either on your flight or separately. There is no limit to the number of pets that can travel as checked baggage, however there may be weight or space limitations based on aircraft type.

Pet owners must supply food and water for the journey. Small carriers should not exceed 69\" (175 cm), medium carriers should not exceed 85\" (217 cm), and large carriers should not exceed 96\" (245 cm).\n\n## Other Restrictions\n\nQatar Airways does not except Exotic and Persian (Shirazi) cats; Greyhound dogs with the exception of pets; Affenpinscher, Pugs, American Pit Bull Terrier, Bichon Frise, Bull dog (all breeds), Boston Terrier, Boxer, Brussels Griffon, Bull Mastiff (English Mastiff) Cane Corso, King Charles Spaniel, Chow Chow, Dogo Argentino, Dogue de Bordeaux (French Mastiff) English Mastiff, Neapolitan Mastiff, Japanese Chin, Pekingese, Presa Canario, Shar Pei, Shih Tzu, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Bull Terrier , Pitbull Terrier, American Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Valley Terrier, and French Terrier.

The service was good- uneventful (which is what you want). The dog arrived safely at the destination.\n\n\n\nThe only issue is/was that Qatar Airways has bad info about the import requirements for Mozambique on their site. They list a Rabies Titer Test as required but it is not. This caused a lot of stress. We had the import permit in hand but was not sure they would let my dog through at check-in (they did). Years later, I'm still trying to get them to update the information on the website.\n\n\n\nBut the service was inexpensive, straightforward, and courteous.

However, as I booked my travel through American, my flights were split with a codeshare - one with an AA flight # and another with a QR flight #, both operated by Qatar - because American does not fly to my destination. Despite repeated attempts (over 30 separate calls at least) to convince Qatar customer service that it was only possible to add my pets to my reservation through them (and not American as they did not operate the flight), I am at a loss to add my pets in advance and can only hope the agents at the counter can help me when I show up with my 2 dogs the day of travel. Additionally, the Qatar customer service helped me and added a support ticket for pet services for my initial travel date, but I had to push my travel date by about 2 months. When trying to explain and provide the reference # for the support ticket, I was still met with the same explanation that their system didn’t allow them to take action (even though they did so earlier in April 2022 for my initial May 2022 travel). American also did not help, but I understood their position better as they do not own the plane and did not have the cargo/checked bagged specs for the plane. This has added a great deal of anxiety for myself and my wife as we attempt to move our family abroad. It’s 2022 people, isn’t there away to have this figured out by now? Cant i conference call both airlines? No, “that’s not policy. You have to call them (American/Qatar) yourself.” I’m tired of getting sent on a wild goose chase, primarily by Qatar.\n\n\nLoad More Reviews\n\nLoading…\n\nFailed.\n[Post a Review](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/34/review/)![Bubble](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bubble.svg)\n\nPost a Review\n\n\n## Traveler Photos\n\n\nWe haven‘t received any photos of dogs flying Qatar Airways yet.\n\n\n\n\nWant to feature your creature?

Small pets are welcome to fly in the cabin with United Airlines.\n\n\n[Visit Website](https://www.united.com/en/us/fly/travel/traveling-with-pets.html)\n\n\nOr call [(800) 864-8331](tel:+18008648331) for more information.\n\n\nYou can use BringFido to find a [pet friendly place to stay](https://www.bringfido.com/lodging/) at your destination.\n\n\n## Pets in the Cabin\n\nSmall pets (dogs, cats and rabbits) can travel in-cabin with United Airlines. Pets must remain inside their pet carrier underneath the seat in front throughout the journey. Only 1 adult cat or dog is allowed in each carrier. Pets must stay in their carrier with the door closed, under the seat at all times. Traveling with pets in-cabin is only allowed for cats and dogs when there’s space available. Puppies and kittens must be at least 2 months old on domestic flights and 4 months old on international flights. The fee for pets in the cabin is $125 each way on United Airlines flights.\n\n## Pets in Checked Baggage\n\nUnfortunately, dogs are not allowed to travel as checked baggage with United Airlines.\n\n## Carrier Guidelines\n\nFor pets traveling with you in the cabin, carriers must be hard or soft-sided. Hard-sided carriers can be a maximum of 17.5\" x 12\" x 7.5\" (44 cm x 30 cm x 19 cm) and soft-sided carriers can be a maximum of 18\" x 11\" x 11\" (46 cm x 28 cm x 28 cm). Pets must be able to stand up and safely turn around in the carrier.\n\n## Reviews\n\nBringFido Guest Rating\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/half.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited Airlines has received a rating of 2.3 out of 5 bones by 41 canine critics on BringFido.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nTravelers report mixed experiences flying with pets on United Airlines. While some travelers had smooth flights with no issues, many others faced challenges, including their pets being denied boarding, even after previously flying successfully with the airline. Customers describe United as having strict and inconsistent policies around pet size and carrier requirements that agents enforce differently across flights and airports. Some travelers felt mistreated by rude and unhelpful staff. However, a few travelers had positive experiences with attentive and accommodating pilots and cargo staff. Overall, the reviews suggest United's pet policies and their application are unpredictable, making the airline a risky choice for those traveling with pets.\n\n\nAI-generated from the text of reviews\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/loading.svg)\n\nLoading reviews…\n\nUnable to load.\n\n\n- [![D.](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/TVnGTVxPKo/review.image.png?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nD.\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nAug. 14, 2024](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1975162)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nAwesome experience\n\n\n\nMy husband and I traveling from Seattle to Porto (Portugal) and back with our little 7lbs Pomeranian. Before we left we made sure we had the correct carrier, with the correct dimensions, and arrived early at the airport. We had reserved a spot for a little dog ahead of time via the customer service hotline. The agent that checked us in looked at the carrier and at our little dog and didn't mention a thing. Same thing on the way back from Portugal. We would fly again with United with our Pomeranian.\n\n- [![Pennie](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/mxXgT8kPgV/PennieRobinson.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nPennie\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nJul. 8, 2024](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1927593)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nNo Problems Flying Two Dogs\n\n\n\nI was horrified at the reviews and was prepared to be turned away at check-in. I have a 30+ pound staffie/terrier mix and a 7 pound maltipom. I have an expandable carrier and portable wheels for my larger dog that worked perfectly. I flew alone and paid for two seats so there was more than enough room for the 3 of us. United is the only airline that will allow one person to fly with two dogs if you purchase an extra seat. I was even allowed to put the smaller dog carrier in my extra seat so I could sooth her because it was her first flight. In Raleigh, NC the agent just requested I expand the carrier for the larger dog so he'd have a little more room while we wait for our flight. I was even allowed to board early so I could get us situated. I'll be flying United with my pups again.\n\n- [![Lucas](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/9PukD9j1Hc/LucasLobe.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nLucas\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1732115)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nAVOID AT ALL COSTS\n\n\n\nI've flown my dog everywhere for years, mainly on Delta. United has the worst and strictest policy you can find. No matter what people say to the contrary, they will NOT let you fly if your dog is slightly too big. Practically ruined my trip. I will never fly United ever again.\n\n- [![Michael](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/mtZ6KlmjCm/Michael_Feinberg.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nMichael\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1675805)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nAVOID, AVOID, AVOID\n\n\n\nDo not take any animal on United. Their policy is vague and leaves everything up to the discrepancy of the rudest desk agents ever. We got berated for being bad pet parents by Lisa at EWR. Our 14lb rat terrier uses (and loves) her sherpa. She has toys in it. She moves around in it just fine. United claimed she was too big and they only transport \"teacup sized dogs.\"\n\n- [![S](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/128mz6dnzO/SE.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nS\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1541077)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nDo not fly with United unless you have a toy pet under 10 lbs\n\n\n\nHorrible experience flying United from LAX to RDU. I booked my pet (15-16 Lb chihuahua mix) through the United Airline call center with no issues, and paid the pet fee on the phone. Once I got to the United counter at LAX, the check-in agent said my pet would not be able to fly since she wasn’t getting up and turning around in her crate. My pet was tired from all the walking we did the day of, and she wanted to rest. She didn’t want to get up and turn around. Luckily, the manager that came by to confirm said we can fly this time but she was going to make sure that my pet would not be able to fly with United again. I am appalled; I have had no issues with Delta, Frontier, American, etc. United was the only airline that gave me heartburn. Just a warning to all-don’t fly United unless your dog is a tea cup or toy breed.\n\n- [![Melissa](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/gKd4IjyKGo/Melissa_Simpson.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nMelissa\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1426137)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nwe can't all be wrong\n\n\n\nUnited can eat a bag of dog biscuits. They denied my toy fox terrier (#10) because of the height issue. They saw her turn around in the bag and admitted to it. The manager was rude and rolled his eyes. There was another lady next to me who's small dog was also denied. I have flown with my dog in a sherpa for years. She is calm and well-behaved. I wound up booking on another airline/flight without issues. That said, I kept my return flight, just to see if they were consistent with the policy, United had no issue with my dog on the return flight at a different airport!!!! She didn't shrink. They are the worst. I pointed this out to the customer service reps when I called. this is completely subjective. I think they should go off of weight, or give an exact shoulder measurement.\n\n- [![Cristina](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/dpFgndC7Yo/CristinaBuendia.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nCristina\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1340360)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nRidiculous \"stand-in carrier\" requirement - denied check-in\n\n\n\nOne bone for a supervisor that did help. But zero for the check-in agent in Seattle who was incredibly rude and unreasonable. She wouldn’t let us fly with our 10-pound dog (who has flown several times with United) because the dog was above the carrier when she lifted her head to look up. I tried to demonstrate to her how the dog was small enough to stand up and turn around inside the carrier when it was closed, but the agent refused to look. She said that we should just take her to Alaska Airlines and she would refund us the pet fee (but all five of us in the family could not get a refund!) We had to call a supervisor who fortunately was kind, allowed us to show him how the dog could stand and turn inside the carrier, and agreed that she could travel. United needs to train its agents, not just about what \"turning around in the carrier\" means (it’s not the height of you the puppy with the head lifted looking up!!!!) but also about how to interact with customers. The agent was rude, condescending, and outright unprofessional even though we were very nice to her. Finally, we will never fly United again when we have our puppy (which is most of the time) - and maybe never, as this experience, despite the supervisor’s help and kindness, has left us feeling mistreated and disrespected. We are very disappointed as we have always flown with United very happily.\n\n- [![C](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nC\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1321800)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nHow can I give negative bones?\n\n\n\nMy dog is a registered service dog but we booked a flight last minute so we did not have time to submit the paperwork prior. He’s small so I decided to just fly him as a pet — like others, we were denied at check in because he cannot stand inside his carrier. This is ridiculous because their height requirement is 11inch max, which means my cat can’t even stand inside the carrier. They then tried to get me to go to a nearby Walmart to buy a bigger carrier, saying that the maximum height limit is 13 inches, which is NOT what their website stated. After showing them their own policies, they were still relentless and said “oh well if the dog is bigger the carrier can be bigger” wtf? That makes NO sense! I’ve flown with my dog both as a service animal and pet prior to him obtaining his credentials more than 10 times with a handful of other airlines and had NEVER had an issue. I ultimately called the United service line and luckily was able to add him as a service animal last minute, but for those traveling with pets, AVOID AVOID AVOID!!! My cortisol levels probably will never be the same.\n\n- [![Teresa](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nTeresa\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1314102)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nONLY FLY UNITED with Pet < 9 in. tall\n\n\n\nNEW POLICY is found nowhere online. But when you arrive to check in, you will be greeted by the most irrational, capricious policy ever. Pictures that indicate not fully erect dogs with heads down in carriers are prohibited from flying because they can not turn around. A funny photo of an 8 inch tall labrador retriever is given as a permitted example. Online a tall cat lying down is shown as acceptable. When I showed this to agent, she said that doesn’t count because I have a dog. 1579 miles from home, I was given no solution, other than returning with a taller carrier, but obviously that would not fit under the seat. Apparently the managing agent was not familiar with the under seat dimensions. Good luck trying to reason with these nimrods!! Fly American!!!

The check in at special services was pretty smooth until a supervisor came around and wanted to see if the 19 pound dog could turn around in crate. He could. He still thought he was borderline and the original check in person thought it would be fine. He finally relented. They did fine on the plane. Was a long flight with a delay so probs 7 hrs. The last hr they were pretty restless. They did go on our laps for the middle 2-3 hrs. Flight attendants didn't care. Had lots of treats and marrow bones to chew on in their carriers. They were groomed prior to the flight so didn't look too big fluffy and we got lucky and were in the comfort plus seats which allowed more leg room. The middle and window seat had lots of room, the aisle I noticed was narrower at the feet. We go back to Boston in a month so let's hope check in goes smoothly in SFO. Domestic flights don't ask for health certificate or rabies certificate. Just the being able to turn in crate and look comfy. I wouldn't never do it for a trip less than 3-4 weeks. The cost is high and it's stressful.\n\n- [![Cameron](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nCameron\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/719301)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nDenied Boarding for my 13 pound doodles\n\n\n\nI have two mini golden doodles, both are 13 pounds and are frequent flyers 50+ flights each.\n\n\n\nI was questioned by the checkin counter saying they can’t stand up and turn around even though they can. The supervisor allowed them to go and I thought it was just a grumpy agent. I then mistakenly flew United again out of a different airport (Newark) and the same thing happened. They told me the dogs couldn’t stand up and turn around and that they now put a note in my file saying I can’t fly with pets on United anymore.\n\n\n\nIt seems like they’ve changed their policy for the worst. My dogs have been flying for 6 years without issue and now this has happened two times within a few months.\n\n\n\nFly another airline if you can.\n\n- [![Pete](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nPete\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1264700)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nDenied boarding\n\n\n\nLike others, my dog was denied boarding.

I I was supposed to travel from Newark to Reno, NV with United airlines on 11/05/22. I had a terrible and unforgettable experience with the staff at United. My dog and I were going to travel, but were unable to do so because apparently he did not fit in his kennel. I have been traveling with United for 9 years with my dog and never have I had a problem until today. The last time we traveled was on May of 2021 and had no problem, my dog even lost weight since then. I always choose pet-in-cabin for the safety of my dog. Never in a million years would I have thought I would go through this, especially with United who’ve I chose in the past. We’ve used the same kennel and his size has not changed and we traveled easily in the past BUT now all of a sudden we can’t anymore? This airline has lost my respect and most importantly a customer. If you are traveling with your furry friend please don’t use this airline!!! Fly with Alaska Airline!!! So long United, I will no longer be traveling here. For those who are considering traveling with United and your pet, this is your sign not to!!\n\n- [![Mya](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nMya\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1219224)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nDenied at DFW Airport\n\n\n\nSadly we were denied with our pup. We had a health certificate from our vet, and he was doing good in the carrier. We were about to be set to go and a woman comes around and yells “HE’S TOO BIG NO.” Me and the lady next to me both got denied. Her pup was smaller than mine. We both are extremely upset and while we sit here trying to figure out what to do, the United employees are making fun of us. Never flying United again.\n\n- [![Scott](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/UWuVkbHBQg/avatar.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nScott\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1038972)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nNo trouble with my 18lbs Cocker Spaniel\n\n\n\nI brought the health report the last few times when flying with Luke, but the latest time I didn't even bring one and everything went fine.

Her size or my bag have never been an issue until today. Now mind you my bag is regulation size for UA and I actually purchased it after it was recommended by them as opposed to my older bag. I got to check in and today suddenly the bag is too small or should I say the dog is too big. She is a stubby legged Havenese who loves her bag...actually jumps in it when we are home to snuggle up. The group of ladies.....6 now..at the counter want her to stand turn and do circus tricks it seemed like on demand. Now she is shaking and nervous. The bag or the dog is deemed too large for the carrier that she has traveled in ON united airlines at least 10 times in the last year...I actually have old bag tags still on there. They absolutely denied boarding and when I called I was told it was the discretion of the agent at the time. The supervisor was also nasty, condescending and confrontational. I also wanted an answer to why today was different and I couldn't get one. Do yourself a favor and find another airline. They are the worse!! I have never had anything like this happen in all my years of flying with my dog!!\n\n- [![Jessica](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nJessica\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1190796)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nIf only there was an option for 0/5\n\n\n\nUnited Airlines is TERRIBLE. They insist that dogs are required to be a certain age to fly but there is NOTHING on the website that says this. They sent me to their pet policy, so I quoted it to them, then they sent me to the CDC website, which did not agree with what they were saying, so I quoted that to them.

Took over an hour to argue with multiple desk agents who felt my dog was too large for the carrier. He can indeed stand and turn around but enjoys laying down in there so kept laying down. When he stood up they said ‘that’s not enough room’. They insisted it ‘wasn’t safe’ despite me having flown with him 10+ times. They were also just extremely rude about it and said ‘well others aren’t doing their job’. Yeah what heros you kept a family apart in a time of crisis. To add insult to injury when my partner and dog declined the flight (with no refund ofc) they booked his seat so I didn’t even get the seat next to me that I booked. Never again with or without dog\n\n\nLoad More Reviews\n\nLoading…\n\nFailed.\n[Post a Review](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/3/review/)![Bubble](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bubble.svg)\n\nPost a Review\n\n\n## Traveler Photos\n\n\nWe haven‘t received any photos of dogs flying United Airlines yet.\n\n\n\n\nWant to feature your creature?

    "markdown": "# International Pet Travel\n\nMany countries have strict regulations regarding international pet travel. You’ll find an overview of bringing Fido to many popular international destinations below. No matter where you’re going, you should contact the embassy or consulate of the destination country to confirm pet travel regulations, obtain all of the necessary paperwork (such as health certificates and documentation) regarding your pet’s travel, and contact your local veterinarian to ensure your pet is in compliance with foreign health regulations.\n\n\n\nFinally, don’t forget to check regulations on bringing Fido back to your home country too. Quarantine rules may apply even if your dog has only been gone a short time. Have more questions about crossing the pond with your pooch?

Each passenger is allowed to bring 2 animals in the cabin. Pets must be at least 15 weeks on flights to/from Germany and 12 weeks for other flights. Animals must be stowed in a carrier under the seat during the flight. Fees for pets traveling in the cabin are calculated using the baggage calculator and depends on the route of travel.\n\n## Pets in Checked Baggage\n\nIf the combined weight of your pet and carrier is over 17 lbs (8 kg), your pet can be transported in the air-conditioned cargo hold instead. Each passenger can only bring 2 animals as checked baggage. Fees for pets traveling as checked baggage depend both on the route and the size of the carrier. A surcharge of EUR 150 / CHF 170 / USD 170 / CAD 220 is charged for transfers via Brussels, Geneva, Frankfurt, Vienna and Zurich.\n\n## Pets in Cargo\n\nDogs that cannot fit in larger carriers or are traveling alone must be transported as cargo instead. For this, you will need a specialized forwarding agent.

London to Malaga (via Frankfurt)\n\n\n\nFirst time flying with my very vocal 2yo Maltipoo in cabin.\n\nCheck-in at LCY was a breeze and the staff were very reassuring.\n\nOn both flights we were asked if there was anything we needed when he started getting vocal. They were very understanding and reassured me that it was just like travelling with a baby, they can be very unpredictable! (Shame some of the passengers didn't feel the same way). He did manage to chew his way out of his bag about half hour before landing at Malaga, much to my horror but everyone else's relief when the whining stopped!\n\nThe staff may not have noticed but I had him in my lap for landing! And they looked surprised and laughed when they saw me carrying him in my arms as we departed the plane and I explained he escaped! 🤦🏼‍♀️ I can only hope Air France are as nice for our return via Paris 🤞🏻🤞🏻\n\n- [![Katherine](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nKatherine\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1215380)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nDO NOT BOOK\n\n\n\nLufthansa has also screwed me over and has not allowed my dog on the final leg of my trip saying Ireland doesnt allow dogs in via the cabin. This is untrue as I have written evidence from the government department with the legislation attached saying that dogs are allowed into Ireland in the cabin. They told me I have no alternative and I am entitled to a refund. They are so rude and mean to deal with.

Our oldest dog, Dick, is already a seaonsed traveller with 3 flights to Greece and Portugal under his belt :), and the younger one just completed his first flight to Portugal and back. Both travelled in the cabin in carrier bags, and were very well received by the crew. We were offered water for both, and were complimented on how well-behaved they were (both slept through all flights!).\n\nThe service was not so easy to book (you needed to call after booking the flight, and wait endlessly on line), but I noticed that recently they changed the web interface and you can now book the dogs online when booking the tickets.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nFranziska\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nAs good as it gets!\n\n\n\nUsed them 3 times now to fly my kids from Germany to the states.

Because it was still a very small dog, I took her in cabin. The one thing i would say though is the seats are very low and the small carrier i had did not fit. The height was the problem, not the width. This could have been a very big problem if the plane had been completely full. The staff was very understanding and it was an excellent experience. I will fly Lufthansa again with my dogs. Would put Lufthansa at the top of my list for flying with a dog.\n\n\nLoad More Reviews\n\nLoading…\n\nFailed.\n[Post a Review](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/33/review/)![Bubble](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bubble.svg)\n\nPost a Review\n\n\n## Traveler Photos\n\n\nWe haven‘t received any photos of dogs flying Lufthansa yet.\n\n\n\n\nWant to feature your creature?

    "markdown": "# Ten Tips for Flying with Fido\n\n\n\n\nTaking his first flight can be a somewhat traumatic experience for a dog that’s used to sticking his head out the car window and enjoying the sights along the way. After all, his view just won’t be the same from underneath the seat in front of you, or even worse, from the cargo hold. But getting there can still be half the fun if you follow the ten tips below and make sure you’re familiar with the [Airline Pet Policy](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/), restrictions on [Pet Travel in the US](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/us_regulations/), and any additional [International Pet Travel](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/international/) restrictions at your destination.\n\n\n## 1\\. Book early\n\nMost airlines only allow one or two dogs on each flight, so it’s important to book your dog’s ticket as soon as possible. Don’t buy your ticket until you call the airline and make sure there is a “seat” available for your dog on the flight. Once the agent has confirmed availability, reserve both your seats on the same ticket while you’re still on the phone with the agent.\n\n\n## 2\\. Fly direct\n\nBook a non-stop, direct flight whenever possible and try to fly on a weekday when airports are typically less hectic. If your pet will be traveling in the cargo hold, it’s best to fly in the morning or evening during the summer, and midday during the winter to avoid extremely hot or cold temperatures.\n\n\n## 3\\. Visit the veterinarian\n\nMake an appointment with your pet’s veterinarian for a check-up and make sure all vaccinations are up to date. Obtain a health certificate from your veterinarian dated within 10 days of departure. For travel outside the continental United States, additional planning and health care requirements may be necessary. Visit our International Pet Travel or contact the foreign office of the country you are traveling to for more information.\n\n\n## 4\\. Buy a carrier\n\nWhether your dog is a Chihuahua or a Great Dane, there’s a pet carrier to match. Carriers are available in both hard-sided and soft-sided. Soft-sided carriers are more suitable for carry-on and tend to fit better under the seat, but they’re only permitted in the cabin only. To make sure the carrier will fit under the seat on your flight check the size restrictions of the airline in our Airline Pet Policies section. If your dog will be traveling in the cargo hold, purchase a hard plastic carrier with holes for ventilation instead. Carriers must be big enough for your dog to stand, turn around, and lie down comfortably. If the carrier does not permit him to do this, the airline will refuse transport.\n\n\n## 5\\. Can I see some ID, ma’am?\n\nAfter you’ve purchased an appropriate carrier, write your dog’s name on it and include identification tags with your home address and phone number as well as the address and phone number of someone who can be reached at your destination. Carry a current photograph of your pet as well. If he’s lost during the trip, a photograph will make it much easier for airline employees or the local authorities to search effectively. You might also want to consider a permanent form of id (such as a microchip or tattoo) that will increase the likelihood of reuniting with your dog if he gets lost on the trip.\n\n\n## 6\\. Take a test drive\n\nAnimals travel under less stress when they are accustomed to their carrier before they travel. In the weeks prior to your trip, put your dog in his carrier as often as possible for trips around town.\n\n\n## 7\\. Eat, drink, poop, then play\n\nSince a full stomach might be uncomfortable for your dog during travel, we recommend feeding him about four hours before the flight, if possible. While it’s best to refrain from feeding your dog right before the flight, you can (and should) continue to give him water right up to the time of travel. Just be sure to empty the dish before checking in so it doesn’t spill during the flight. If you’re checking the dog, leave the dishes in the carrier so an airline employee can provide your pet with food and water in the event of an extended delay before or after your flight. You should also exercise your pet and let him use the facilities (i.e. grass) before heading to the airport.\n\n\n## 8\\. Arrive early\n\nArrive at the airport early, but not too early, and have your dog’s health certificate handy. You will not be allowed to check your pet in more than four hours before the flight. Most airlines recommend arriving two hours before your flight when traveling with a pet. Passengers with pets must check-in at the counter; curbside and self service check-in are not allowed.\n\n\n## 9\\. -Don’t- take a Valium\n\nWe don’t mind if you take a Valium before the flight, but don’t give your pet tranquilizers just because you’re nervous. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, in most cases, dogs should not be given sedatives or tranquilizers prior to flying because they can create respiratory and cardiovascular problems as the dog is exposed to increased altitude pressures. They can also alter the animal’s natural ability to balance and maintain equilibrium, which can be dangerous when the carrier is moved. While sedation is generally not advised, the decision on whether or not to prescribe a tranquilizer for your pet should be made by your veterinarian. If he or she decides that tranquilizers are medically necessary for the trip, indicate the name of the drug taken and the dosage on the dog’s carrier.\n\n\n## 10\\. You’ve arrived!\n\nWhen you arrive at your destination, go for a long walk before you check in at the hotel. Your dog will feel more comfortable as soon as he sees (and smells) his new surroundings, and realizes that the same rules and boundaries apply here too. By the time you check into the hotel, your dog will already feel right and home and be ready for whatever adventures are in store for him that week.\n\n\n* * *\n\n## Packing List\n\nDon’t forget these items when packing your dog’s suitcase:\n\n\n- Health certificate and medical records\n- Contact information for your regular veterinarian and an emergency contact at your destination\n- Comb, brush, and flea control products\n- Any special medication your dog might need\n- Spare collar with id tag\n- Pet wipes or grooming products\n- Paper towels and stain remover\n- Enough dog food and treats for the entire trip\n- Plenty of bottled water (a sudden change can upset your dog’s stomach)\n- Food and water dishes\n- Leash and poop bags\n- Your dog’s favorite toy and blanket\n- A list of [dog friendly restaurants](https://www.bringfido.com/restaurant/) and [attractions](https://www.bringfido.com/attraction/) at your destination\n\n\nYour Privacy\n\n\nWe use cookies to deliver our services, personalize content, and get feedback on how people use BringFido so that we can improve.\nBy clicking OK, you accept this as outlined in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.bringfido.com/privacy/#cookies).\n\n\nOK\n\n[iframe](https://www.bringfido.com/google/onetap/)",

    "markdown": "# Airline Pet Policies\n\nPlanning to fly with your dog? While air travel can be a quick way to get Fido from one place to another, you should know that every airline has different rules about transporting pets. Some allow small dogs to travel in the aircraft cabin as part of your carry-on luggage allowance, while others will only allow pets to travel in the cargo area, and fees can vary from nothing at all to more than $500. Also, most airlines only allow one or two dogs on each flight, so always make sure a “seat” is available for your dog BEFORE buying your own ticket.\n\n\nTo take off without a hitch, please read our [Ten Tips for Flying with Fido](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/top_10_tips/), and familiarize yourself with current [U.S. Travel Regulations](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/us_regulations/) or [International Pet Travel](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/international/) restrictions before you go.

    "markdown": "# Ten Tips for Flying with Fido\n\n\n\n\nTaking his first flight can be a somewhat traumatic experience for a dog that’s used to sticking his head out the car window and enjoying the sights along the way. After all, his view just won’t be the same from underneath the seat in front of you, or even worse, from the cargo hold. But getting there can still be half the fun if you follow the ten tips below and make sure you’re familiar with the [Airline Pet Policy](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/), restrictions on [Pet Travel in the US](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/us_regulations/), and any additional [International Pet Travel](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/international/) restrictions at your destination.\n\n\n## 1\\. Book early\n\nMost airlines only allow one or two dogs on each flight, so it’s important to book your dog’s ticket as soon as possible. Don’t buy your ticket until you call the airline and make sure there is a “seat” available for your dog on the flight. Once the agent has confirmed availability, reserve both your seats on the same ticket while you’re still on the phone with the agent.\n\n\n## 2\\. Fly direct\n\nBook a non-stop, direct flight whenever possible and try to fly on a weekday when airports are typically less hectic. If your pet will be traveling in the cargo hold, it’s best to fly in the morning or evening during the summer, and midday during the winter to avoid extremely hot or cold temperatures.\n\n\n## 3\\. Visit the veterinarian\n\nMake an appointment with your pet’s veterinarian for a check-up and make sure all vaccinations are up to date. Obtain a health certificate from your veterinarian dated within 10 days of departure. For travel outside the continental United States, additional planning and health care requirements may be necessary. Visit our International Pet Travel or contact the foreign office of the country you are traveling to for more information.\n\n\n## 4\\. Buy a carrier\n\nWhether your dog is a Chihuahua or a Great Dane, there’s a pet carrier to match. Carriers are available in both hard-sided and soft-sided. Soft-sided carriers are more suitable for carry-on and tend to fit better under the seat, but they’re only permitted in the cabin only. To make sure the carrier will fit under the seat on your flight check the size restrictions of the airline in our Airline Pet Policies section. If your dog will be traveling in the cargo hold, purchase a hard plastic carrier with holes for ventilation instead. Carriers must be big enough for your dog to stand, turn around, and lie down comfortably. If the carrier does not permit him to do this, the airline will refuse transport.\n\n\n## 5\\. Can I see some ID, ma’am?\n\nAfter you’ve purchased an appropriate carrier, write your dog’s name on it and include identification tags with your home address and phone number as well as the address and phone number of someone who can be reached at your destination. Carry a current photograph of your pet as well. If he’s lost during the trip, a photograph will make it much easier for airline employees or the local authorities to search effectively. You might also want to consider a permanent form of id (such as a microchip or tattoo) that will increase the likelihood of reuniting with your dog if he gets lost on the trip.\n\n\n## 6\\. Take a test drive\n\nAnimals travel under less stress when they are accustomed to their carrier before they travel. In the weeks prior to your trip, put your dog in his carrier as often as possible for trips around town.\n\n\n## 7\\. Eat, drink, poop, then play\n\nSince a full stomach might be uncomfortable for your dog during travel, we recommend feeding him about four hours before the flight, if possible. While it’s best to refrain from feeding your dog right before the flight, you can (and should) continue to give him water right up to the time of travel. Just be sure to empty the dish before checking in so it doesn’t spill during the flight. If you’re checking the dog, leave the dishes in the carrier so an airline employee can provide your pet with food and water in the event of an extended delay before or after your flight. You should also exercise your pet and let him use the facilities (i.e. grass) before heading to the airport.\n\n\n## 8\\. Arrive early\n\nArrive at the airport early, but not too early, and have your dog’s health certificate handy. You will not be allowed to check your pet in more than four hours before the flight. Most airlines recommend arriving two hours before your flight when traveling with a pet. Passengers with pets must check-in at the counter; curbside and self service check-in are not allowed.\n\n\n## 9\\. -Don’t- take a Valium\n\nWe don’t mind if you take a Valium before the flight, but don’t give your pet tranquilizers just because you’re nervous. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, in most cases, dogs should not be given sedatives or tranquilizers prior to flying because they can create respiratory and cardiovascular problems as the dog is exposed to increased altitude pressures. They can also alter the animal’s natural ability to balance and maintain equilibrium, which can be dangerous when the carrier is moved. While sedation is generally not advised, the decision on whether or not to prescribe a tranquilizer for your pet should be made by your veterinarian. If he or she decides that tranquilizers are medically necessary for the trip, indicate the name of the drug taken and the dosage on the dog’s carrier.\n\n\n## 10\\. You’ve arrived!\n\nWhen you arrive at your destination, go for a long walk before you check in at the hotel. Your dog will feel more comfortable as soon as he sees (and smells) his new surroundings, and realizes that the same rules and boundaries apply here too. By the time you check into the hotel, your dog will already feel right and home and be ready for whatever adventures are in store for him that week.\n\n\n* * *\n\n## Packing List\n\nDon’t forget these items when packing your dog’s suitcase:\n\n\n- Health certificate and medical records\n- Contact information for your regular veterinarian and an emergency contact at your destination\n- Comb, brush, and flea control products\n- Any special medication your dog might need\n- Spare collar with id tag\n- Pet wipes or grooming products\n- Paper towels and stain remover\n- Enough dog food and treats for the entire trip\n- Plenty of bottled water (a sudden change can upset your dog’s stomach)\n- Food and water dishes\n- Leash and poop bags\n- Your dog’s favorite toy and blanket\n- A list of [dog friendly restaurants](https://www.bringfido.com/restaurant/) and [attractions](https://www.bringfido.com/attraction/) at your destination\n\n\nYour Privacy\n\n\nWe use cookies to deliver our services, personalize content, and get feedback on how people use BringFido so that we can improve.\nBy clicking OK, you accept this as outlined in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.bringfido.com/privacy/#cookies).\n\n\nOK\n\n[iframe](https://www.bringfido.com/google/onetap/)",

    "markdown": "# Airline Pet Policies\n\nPlanning to fly with your dog? While air travel can be a quick way to get Fido from one place to another, you should know that every airline has different rules about transporting pets. Some allow small dogs to travel in the aircraft cabin as part of your carry-on luggage allowance, while others will only allow pets to travel in the cargo area, and fees can vary from nothing at all to more than $500. Also, most airlines only allow one or two dogs on each flight, so always make sure a “seat” is available for your dog BEFORE buying your own ticket.\n\n\nTo take off without a hitch, please read our [Ten Tips for Flying with Fido](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/top_10_tips/), and familiarize yourself with current [U.S. Travel Regulations](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/us_regulations/) or [International Pet Travel](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/international/) restrictions before you go.

Pets are welcome in the cabin and as checked baggage on select flights.\n\n\n[Visit Website](https://www.westjet.com/en-ca/pets)\n\n\nOr call [(888) 937-8538](tel:+18889378538) for more information.\n\n\nYou can use BringFido to find a [pet friendly place to stay](https://www.bringfido.com/lodging/) at your destination.\n\n\n## Pet Reservations\n\nWestJet does not allow pets to be reserved online. To add your pet to your travel plans, contact WestJet Customer Service at (888) 937-8538 to speak to a representative. The number of pets allowed on each aircraft varies, so book Fido's place early to guarantee a place on board.\n\n## Pets in the Cabin\n\nWestJet welcomes a number of different pets (dogs, cats, rabbits, and some types of bird) to join you in the cabin. Fido must be small enough to fit in a carrier underneath the seat in front of you. Passengers are permitted to travel with 1 pet each. The pet fee for travel within/between Canada and the U.S. is $50 to $59 CAD/USD, and for travel between Canada/U.S. and all destinations outside the U.S. is $100 to $118 CAD/USD.\n\n## Pets in Checked Baggage\n\nWestJet welcomes certain animals (cats, dogs, rabbits, birds, chinchillas, guinea pigs, and hedgehogs) to travel as checked baggage in the hold. The maximum combined weight of your pet and carrier is 100 lbs (45 kg). During times of extreme temperature in the cargo area of planes, pets won't be allowed to travel. The pet fee for travel within/between Canada and the U.S. is $100 to $118 CAD/USD, and travel between Canada/U.S. and all destinations outside the U.S. is $200 - $236 CAD/USD.\n\n## Pets in Cargo\n\nPassengers with pets who exceed the weight limit for travel in the hold, or those being transported alone, can contact WestJet Cargo Team at (866) 952-2746.\n\n## Carrier Guidelines\n\nFor pets traveling in the cabin, carriers should have maximum dimensions of 16\" x 8.5\" x 10\" in (41 cm x 21.5 cm x 25.4 cm). Carriers should be soft-sided, airline-approved, leak-proof, secure, and well-ventilated. For pets traveling in the hold, carriers should not exceed the dimensions 40\" x 27\" x 30\" (101 cm x 68 cm x 76 cm). Carriers should be hard-sided, have the wheels removed, be airline-approved, well ventilated, lined with absorbent material like a towel, marked with \"LIVE ANIMAL\" and \"THIS WAY UP\" arrows on 2 sides, and marked with your pet's name. Provide your pooch with built-in food and water containers as well.\n\n## Other Restrictions\n\nWestJet does not allow pets to travel from December 15th through January 6th each year.\n\n## Reviews\n\nBringFido Guest Rating\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWestJet has received a rating of 3.2 out of 5 bones by 13 canine critics on BringFido.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nVisitors generally express mixed opinions about WestJet's pet policies.

Westjet’s representative confirmed that our dog would be able to come as long as he was healthy. No further information was shared, by the representative. We booked a flight accordingly to avoid any extra charges with other airlines and to make the trip seamless for our little dog. The flight was bought through Westjet, and contained 2 flights, the second of his was operated by Delta Airlines. However, when it came to booking our dog on the flight, Westjet shared they were not able to add him on the flight because they have a rule which indicates that pets cannot be booked via Westjet if there are 2 separate carriers (in our case Westjet and Delta Airlines). This was never shared to us before. The only rationale we were given is that this is just Westjet’s rule. We were not given the right information from the beginning. If this was the case we would have made other arrangements beforehand for our dog or booked flights accordingly. Not impressed by Westjet’s lack of communication.\n\n- [![Sha](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/njwewqH3LV/Sha_Snellen.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nSha\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1477757)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nWestjet Not Pet Friendly !!!!!!!\n\n\n\nI travelled with my dog to Aruba and the flight attendant was very aggressive and gave me a lecture how privileged I am to travel with a dog.

Due to the fact that I have to change the airlines, my miniature Dashchund is not accepted on the WestJet flight. It was confirmed with Air France and Tarom, but WestJet completely refused to add him on their flight. Since it is not possible to fly only with WestJet all the way to Bucharest, they make it impossible to take your pet along on extended routes. I will not book my flights with WestJet in the future! Extremely dissatisfied with their policies and customer service! I would choose 0 bones for that.\n\n- [![Kim](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nKim\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/900317)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nWestjet is Reliable When it Comes to Flying your Pet\n\n\n\nMy dog recently passed away but I had flown my dog many many times for the last 10+ years on Westjet. There have been times where a Westjet agent may not be as enamoured with having to process your pet (Maybe not a dog lover) but overall, the experience has been good. My only negative that I always hope that Westjet will change is allowing your pet to come off \"first\" vs the \"luggage\" when flying into a smaller airport - ie. Victoria or Comox airport. My dog was super stressed flying and it's a long day for your pet and for the owner and now that they landed, you are having to wait until all that luggage comes off before your very anxious pet gets reunited. I do love how they give you the confirmation that your pet is on board (sometimes they need reminding) but overall they care.\n\n- [![Val](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nVal\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/881511)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\n#1 HERDING DOG REFUSED FLIGHT TO ATTEND COMPETITION\n\n\n\nI would give a 0 rating if possible. Thanks to WestJet, Marshall and I are unable to fly to Vancouver island for the year end competition. We were booked to fly from Calgary and when I went to check in, they weighed him and his kennel and denied board because he was slightly over the limit. I was instructed to ship him cargo.\n\n\n\nI booked Marshall’s cargo ticket for travel the following day and changed my flight as well. I arrived at the Cargo office at 6:20 am, 3 1/2 hours before the flight departed to make sure he got checked in and I could get to the main terminal and through security for my flight. After sitting in the cargo office for two and a half hours they told me his shipment was rejected because he is too big for his kennel. So my 25 inch, 85 pound dog was not able to travel on WestJet, period. Website indicates cargo accepts pets up to 160 pounds. Dog has to be able stand, turn around and lay down which he does. He is a show dog and this is his regular kennel. I couldn’t cancel my flight because the timeline had passed to do so online and we all know what the wait times are when you try to call! Yay more time out of my life I’ll never get back to deal with that.\n\n\n\nInconsistently applied rules don’t make for happy customers. Similar sized dogs travelling to the competition were either not weighed, or granted some leeway. My dog was 5 pounds over the 100 pound “limit” and considered “too big” for cargo shipment. So I missed the competition and had to forfeit entry fees and other show expenses. Another exhibitor had a similar issue. It took WestJet 2 days to decide whether her dog would be accepted to fly. What happened WestJet? You used to be the friendly airline.\n\n- [![Kelsie](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/477572/asid10157535947762767height50width50ext1569001366hashAeQXvka1TchJ0xMu?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nKelsie\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/280175)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nWe <3 WestJet!\n\n\n\nRecently flew from Alberta to Newfoundland direct with WestJet and brought along my 40lb mutt, Groot. He travelled in the kennel underneath the plane. WestJet was awesome! From the check-in staff to the flight attendant who brought us our slip to let us know he was on the plane safely to the baggage handlers who offloaded him at the oversized luggage area - he was well looked after. Strongly recommend if you are flying with a pet in Cargo that you fly WestJet.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nnatalia\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nNot Impressed\n\n\n\nI am an animal lover and will be taking my two cats with me in the cabin when we immigrate to the USA, HOWEVER, my recent experience with WestJet was less than satisfactory. The lady travelling next to me had a dog - on her lap - who was licking, jumping all over me and was not in a carrier at all the entire flight. To me, this is unacceptable. If you are going to travel with pets, please ensure they are in a carrier.

In regards to the seats on this flight....they keep getting smaller...and even though I called and asked if my dimensions worked prior to the flight the bag did not fit. I think maybe a hamster bag could have fit under these seats.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nGina\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nCharlie our King Charles Cavalier loves flying West Jet 🐶\n\n\n\nOur Charlie is a frequent flyer with WestJet. He has been several times to Mexico, as well as Vancouver with us. He is so quiet that people can not believe we had a dog in cabin with us. We have never had a problem with WestJet. They have always been kind, even bringing us a bit of water for him if needed. He usually sleeps the whole flight though. So thankful for this allowance in flight , as we are gone for a month at a time in the winter and couldn't be without my pup. Thank you WestJet\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nColeen\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nWEST JET IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THEIR POLICY\n\n\n\nI flew three flights with our Cairn Terrier who is 18lbs and her carrier is 1lb which makes her under the 20lb rule. On the 3rd flight I had a very difficult time getting her on board as they said she didn't fit into her carrier. The same carrier that she voluntarily sleeps in each night. I leave it open in our front entry and she spends her naps times and nights comfortably in it. I was sternly warned that I would not likely be permitted to fly with her in the cabin again as she was not able to sit up inside of her kennel. This is not true and it is the opinion of one person who has now flagged me and when I check in with her in the future I will inevitably have to get a supervisor to assure that things are OK. However, I had zero trouble with her on previous flights. All flights are 1 hour and 17 minutes in duration. Even after sharing how our pooch is more then happy to go inside, turn around, sit (she lays down almost immediately because this is where she naps. The counter agent made me feel awful and that I was abusing my precious pup. She is 12 and has travelled via car on 3 day trips and was a former show pup, so she is used to being out of her element. She navigates the airport happily and actually chooses to rest in her carrier while we wait. I have 3 pre-paid flights with her on the reservation but I am worried that I will be denied boarding, which will definitely be a huge hassle. I spoke with West Jet customer care and they said that if I want assure her boarding, I should place her in cargo. I am just frustrated that I have without any hassle travelled with this airline and because of one persons unwilling to be reasonable I am going to be forced to purchase yet another airline approved hard-sided kennel. I will now have 3 crates/carriers.\n\nBeing inconsistent with their policy makes me worry that maybe they are inconsistent with other aspects of their airline. I have been a raving fan of West Jet up until this most recent experience.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nCarol\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\n80lb gsd\n\n\n\nWhen my Gsd was a puppy we travelled from cabo San Lucas to Edmonton, I was so amazed at the quality of service given by westjet, especially the hostess bringing me the receipt to my seat to say that my dog had been loaded on the plane, phew what a relief I was worried that he would not get loaded in cargo. Made my flight even more relaxed. But unfortunately my gsd has outgrown westjet said size limititations he now needs the 700 series giant kennel and westjet does not accept that size. So sorry westjet we will be unable to fly with your great service anymore.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nKT\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nFlight was a success\n\n\n\nFlew YEG to CUN (Edmonton to Cancun) with three dogs: 76 pounds, 65 pounds and 32 pounds. All had to be checked baggage and only 3 flights per dog. Booked our reservation over the phone- Don't book online as you need to confirm they are on the flight with you. Arrive early (3 hours) so you can book them in We had great staff, petting them, asking if they could have treats etc. while we booked them in. No issues. One dog was slightly overweight so asked us to put her in a lighter crate (switch dog/crate we had) so we did but no issue. They were really good in Canada and Mexico. It can be done!\n\n\nLoad More Reviews\n\nLoading…\n\nFailed.\n[Post a Review](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/19/review/)![Bubble](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bubble.svg)\n\nPost a Review\n\n\n## Traveler Photos\n\n\nWe dug up a picture of a dog flying WestJet.\n\n\n\n![Charlie loves Flying with WestJet](https://photos.bringfido.com/photo/2017/02/21/IMG_0368.JPG?size=block219&density=2x)\n\n\nWant to feature your creature?

Pets are welcome to travel in the cabin and as checked baggage in the hold with KLM.\n\n\n[Visit Website](https://www.klm.com/travel/us_en/prepare_for_travel/travel_planning/pets/index.htm)\n\n\nOr call [(866) 434-0320](tel:+18664340320) for more information.\n\n\nYou can use BringFido to find a [pet friendly place to stay](https://www.bringfido.com/lodging/) at your destination.\n\n\n## Pets in the Cabin\n\nKLM welcomes small cats and dogs into the economy cabin on most of their flights, and in business class on flights within Europe. Dogs are welcome in the cabin if the combined weight of the pet and carrier is under 18 lbs (8 kg). Each passenger is permitted to travel with 1 pet. To bring your cat or dog with you, you’ll pay a fee of EUR 75 to EUR 400 per one-way.\n\n## Pets in Checked Baggage\n\nPets and carriers weighing more than 18 lbs (8 kg) can be transported in the hold with KLM. To travel as checked baggage in the hold, pets and carriers can weigh a maximum 165 lbs (75 kg). Passengers can check up to 3 pets in the hold. If you have a transfer time of more than 3 hours, or your flight is operated with a Boeing 787-9 or 787-10 aircraft, then you are not allowed to travel with a pet in the hold. To bring your cat or dog with you, you’ll pay a fee of EUR 75 to EUR 400 per one-way.\n\n## Pets in Cargo\n\nPets that exceed the maximum weight for traveling in the hold, those traveling alone, or animals that are heading to countries where they require pets to be transported as freight, can all go through Air France-KLM Cargo instead, where animals are shipped with a special cargo agent. Pets and carriers weighing more than 165 lbs (75 kg) or exceeding 115\" (292 cm) in height must travel this way. On some types of aircraft, the kennel must not be larger than 97\" (247 cm). You can contact them directly at 800-556-9000 to find out prices, availability, and conditions for your pet's travel plans.\n\n## Carrier Guidelines\n\nFor animals traveling in the cabin, carriers must be soft-sided and no bigger than 18\" x 11\" x 9\" (46 cm x 28 cm x 24 cm). Pets must be able to stand up and lay down comfortably inside. For pets traveling in the hold, carriers must not exceed the dimensions of 48\" x 32\" x 35\" (122 cm x 81 cm x 89 cm) on KLM flights and 40\" x 27\" x 30\" (102 cm x 69 cm x 76 cm) on KLM Cityhopper flights. Carriers must alsohave a fiberglass or rigid plastic shell, wheels must be removed or blocked with duct tape, the door must have a centralized locking system, and the two parts of the carrier must be joined by bolts. It must be large enough for your pet to stand up without touching the top, turn around easily, and lie down in a natural position.\n\n## Other Restrictions\n\nUnfortunately, snub-nosed breeds are not allowed to travel with KLM. Animals of this type must be transported via KLM Cargo. The following dog breeds are not accepted for travel with KLM: Affenpinscher, American Bully, Boston Terrier, Boxers (all breeds), Bulldogs (all breeds), Bull Mastiff, Cane Corso, Pugs (all breeds), Chow-Chow, Great Dane (all breeds), Certain breeds of Spaniel (Tibetan, Japanese, English, King Charles), Brussels Griffon, Lhasa Apso, Mastiffs (all breeds), Neapolitan Mastiff, Pekingese, Small Brabant, Shih Tzu, Shar Pei, Staffordshire Bull Terrier. The following cat breeds are not permitted: Burmese, Exotic Shorthair, Himalayan, and Persian.\n\n## Reviews\n\nBringFido Guest Rating\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKLM Royal Dutch Airlines has received a rating of 4.0 out of 5 bones by 0 canine critics on BringFido.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/loading.svg)\n\nLoading reviews…\n\nUnable to load.\n\n\n- [![Nele](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/URwVloSPcR/asid10200541726205621height50width50ext1636386933hashAeT8IvGRdaILBIYeRpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nNele\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/847841)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nGreat experience, kind staff\n\n\n\nI flew with my cat in the cabin from Netherlands to Spain.

In Amsterdam this airline has a special dog hotel stop where they feed and water the dog, they let the dog out for potty and even clean the cage if necessary. On both flights the very nice staff reassurede that my dog was indeed on board and that the pressure and the temperature is fine for my dog in the luggage department in the belly of the plane. When I arrived to Mexico I was surprised to see that the kennel of my dog was replaced by a bigger one, to make her feel more comfortable. I am so so so pleased with their services and their sensitivity to people who fly with dogs!

Pets can travel in the cabin and as cargo on select flights with Delta Air Lines.\n\n\n[Visit Website](https://www.delta.com/us/en/pet-travel/overview)\n\n\nOr call [(800) 221-1212](tel:+18002211212) for more information.\n\n\nYou can use BringFido to find a [pet friendly place to stay](https://www.bringfido.com/lodging/) at your destination.\n\n\n## Pet Reservations\n\nDelta Air Lines limits the number of pets per flight to 2 in first class, 2 in business class, and 4 in the main cabin.\n\n## Pets in the Cabin\n\nDelta Air Lines welcomes passengers with small pets (dogs, cats, and household birds) in the cabin on select flights within the United States, Canada, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Pets are not permitted on flights to Hawaii. To qualify for travel in the cabin, your pet must be small enough to fit comfortably in a carrier under the seat in front of you. Pets must be at least 10 weeks old for domestic travel, 16 weeks old if traveling to the USA from elsewhere, and 15 weeks old for European Union travel. Passengers can bring 1 pet in each carrier, except on domestic flights in the USA where a female cat or dog may travel with her litter if they are 10 weeks to 6 months old. There is no limit on the number of animals in the litter. Fees for taking your pet in the cabin vary depending on your travel plans. Flights to/from the U.S.A, Canada, Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands incur a pet fee of $95, flights outside the U.S. incur a pet fee of $200; and flights to Brazil incur a pet fee of $75.\n\n## Pets in Checked Baggage\n\nUnfortunately, Delta Air Lines does not allow pets to travel as checked baggage.\n\n## Pets in Cargo\n\nAnimals who are too large to be taken in the cabin, or are being transported separately from their owner, can be shipped as cargo through Delta Cargo. Pets shipped domestically via Delta Cargo cannot be booked until 14 days prior to departure, pets are not guaranteed to be shipped on the same flight as their owner. Shipping a pet requires dropping it off at a Delta Cargo location at least 3 hours before departure.\n\n## Carrier Guidelines\n\nFor pets traveling in the cabin, maximum carry-on kennel dimensions are determined by your flight. You must contact Delta Reservations to determine the appropriate kennel size. However, a soft-sided carrier with dimensions of 18” x 11” x 11” (45 cm x 28 cm x 28 cm) is recommended as this will fit on most Delta aircrafts. Pets must remain inside the carrier while in the airport boarding area, during boarding, as well as throughout the duration of each flight. For pets traveling with Delta Cargo, carriers can have any of the following dimensions (as long as pets fit comfortably inside): 27\" x 20\" x 19\" (68 cm x 50 cm x 48 cm); 32\" x 22\" x 23\" (81 cm x 55 cm x 58 cm); 36\" x 24\" x 26\" (91 cm x 61 cm x 66 cm); 40\" x 27\" x 30\" (101 cm x 68 cm x 76 cm); and 48\" x 32\" x 35\" (122 cm x 81 cm x 89 cm). Kennels must be rigid with a solid top, have proper ventilation on at least 3 sides domestically or 4 on international flights, have a solid door, and nuts and bolts securing loose parts. The kennel should be large enough for animals to stand, turn around, and lie down comfortably. Carriers must include food and water dishes clipped securely inside and absorbent material on the bottom.\n\n## Other Restrictions\n\nDelta does not accept brachycephalic breeds, including American Bulldog, American Staffordshire Terrier, American Pit Bull Terrier, Boston Terrier, Boxer, Brussels Griffin, Bulldog, Chinese Pug, Chow Chow, Dutch Pug, English Bulldog, English Toy Spaniel, French Bulldog, Lhasa Apso, Japanese Boxer, Japanese Pug, Japanese Spaniel (Chin), Mastiff (all breeds), Pekinese, Pit Bull, Pug, Shar Pei, Shih Tzu, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Tibetan Spaniel; and cats, such as Burmese, Exotic, Himalayan, and Persian.\n\n## Reviews\n\nBringFido Guest Rating\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelta Air Lines has received a rating of 3.1 out of 5 bones by 22 canine critics on BringFido.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nTravelers generally have positive experiences with Delta Air Lines when bringing their pets onboard, though some report issues with certain agents being overly strict about pet carrier size.

Most often American Airlines, but also Delta regularly and occasionally United. In my experience, Delta has never given me any trouble checking in and they are incredibly nice at Hartsfield in Atlanta.\n\nUnited is most likely to be picky and they have made me demonstrate that my dog can stand up and turn around in her under seat carrier, which I think is a stupid rule for in cabin pets. American is ok but often I get agents that have never checked in a pet and the process takes a long time since they have to go get someone to coach them through the process.\n\nI would pick Delta every time for an easy, no hassle check in and flight.\n\n- [![Sara](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nSara\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1703153)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nDo Not Fly Delta With In Cabin Dog!\n\n\n\nOn our flight we had our two dogs and the way we were treated was extremely disrespectful. It was our dogs first flight so they were a little scared and we were delayed waiting for de-icing. The dogs whined a bit and couple little barks and the flight attendants approached us right away to get them “under control”. A couple minutes later the next flight attendant came and threaten to de-board us because our dogs whined a couple times. They did not ask if we needed anything. No one on the plane was complaining. It was extremely stressful for us and the dogs. I felt extremely uncomfortable and unwelcome and was very anxious for the whole flight after that. When gearing up for landing the flight attendant came by and rudely said “you know they have to go under the seat for landing.” Acting as if we were dumb and knew nothing. No one else around us was told to put their bags under the seats. I felt extremely targeted and bullied once I stepped foot on the flight with my dogs.\n\nWe put a complaint in with customer care and they pretty much did nothing. They offered us $50 vouchers that can only be used on another flight within the year. I will never fly with them again with our dogs. Awful airline.\n\n- [![Pablo](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/BDfBq9bExb/PabloAvils.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nPablo\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1594274)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nSome unnecessary attitude from attendant.\n\n\n\nWe flew our 12 lb maltipoo from LAX to Orlando, Tofu had just arrived from a long flight from China and he was quite scared about everything happening around him. He never barks or makes any sound all he needed was to stick out his little head to see us and feel safe. Most of the staff even came to say hi but this dog hating attendant started raising her voice to us that he had to be completely inside the carrier. As I tried to put him back in he was resisting and she was waiting there to see me push him in, I just said I was trying as he was resisting a bit to bend down and then she raised her voice to us and started scolding me for having opened the top zip in the first instance. In the end she made her little scene and got her dose of attention of course but quite unnecessary in my opinion. My wife and I were the only passengers seating in that row she made sure we felt as if we committed a big crime and something serious would await us after landing. Nothing happened in the end but the attitude and lack of empathy towards the dog made us conclude we’ll look for other airlines in the future.\n\n- [![Courtney](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/dFzdvUKME8/CourtneyElliott.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nCourtney\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1460807)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nDon’t go through LAX with your pet unless VERY small\n\n\n\nRecently we had a trip booked from LAX to EWR. Originally I booked on United but after seeing all the reviews we canceled our United flight and booked through Delta, choosing to instead go to JFK, even though it was out of the way, but wanted to make sure we had no issues. Most all of the reviews I read for Delta, people had no issues, but of course after switching our flight, I started hearing about how some people had issues specifically flying out of LAX on Delta, and that proved to be true. My puppy is only 13 pounds, and had a carrier that was rated up to 25 pounds. He can move around it with zero issues and has tons of space. He likes to lean on the side though and the Delta agent immediately decided he was too big. She called over her manager who did let us fly, but not without a big lecture first, which frankly was obnoxious. Our return flight on Delta, out of BTV, we had zero issues. The agent just asked us a few questions and sent us along our way. Needless to say we will never fly Delta out of LAX again and unless you have a very small dog I definitely don’t recommend trying. The manager said she turns away multiple dogs a day.\n\n- [![Marta](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nMarta\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1417179)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nDepends on Agent\n\n\n\nOverall, Delta has been fairly travel-friendly for my 18 lb mini-goldendoodle. She was a pandemic puppy (now 3.5 years old) and has been traveling since she was 12 weeks long distances (predominantly Boston - Seattle). She's the most well-behaved, calm pup and LOVES her carrier - jumps into it by herself and her carrier fits fine on most Delta aircraft (including the smaller embraer 170/175s that go between Boston - NYC). I travel a lot for work and typically don't have problems, but have definitely run into a handful of instances where the agent thinks my dog is too big. As someone else said, it's really about the agent you get - some don't even look, others bring other people over and tell me she's too large (she's tall and fluffy, but can absolutely move around comfortably in her carrier). It's frustrating because you never know who you'll get and how the experience will be. Additionally, calling to add the pet to the reservation is a pain - I typically just use the Delta app to message an agent and copy/paste the save verbiage that they always require (size, breed, age, carrier dimensions, etc). It's also helpful to look at your aircraft in advance so you can ensure your carrier will fit depending on the plane/class you're in.\n\n- [![Sandee](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nSandee\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1162407)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nNo problems\n\n\n\nI recently flew roundtrip on Delta from Boston to Kalispell, MT and I did not have any problems bringing my dog on board. The ticket agent gave me a tag for my carrier and did not ask to look at my pet. The last time I flew American, they asked to see my dog and then they didn't want to let me board the flight because they said my dog could not walk around comfortably in the carrier. I recommend Delta for traveling with pets on board, they are easy going and welcoming to pets.\n\n- [![Michelle](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/8G2PXFG5AH/edison_pump.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nMichelle\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1086405)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nDelta - 2022 Pet Fee DECREASED!!!\n\n\n\nI have to travel from Daytona Beach to LGA with my dog.

He was a big boy...I disclosed this with the reservation agent that added my frenchie to my reservation - something you need to do prior to your flight since it's first come first serve and there's a limit to the number of pets allowed per flight. At six months, my frenchie had been riding around in his carrier for three months and was very comfortable. I have a large Sherpa brand soft carrier that met the max size allowable. Cut to the chase, I get to the counter, the agent asked me to place my frenchie and carrier on the scale. She then asked me to unzip the bag...upon seeing my frenchie, she told me that he was too big although he was laying comfortably in the bag. She asked two red coats for their opinion - they also said he was too big. After more pleading the two red coats asked three more red coats...the three red coats all said YES. It was an anxiety filled experience. Their main complaint was that my frenchie couldn't stand in his carrier to which I answered, he doesn't stand in his carrier, he lays down and sleeps! Anyway, once we got through my frenchie slept through the entire flight. On the return trip, the agent didn't even ask to see my pup. All she asked for was his health certificate, which I had along with all his vaccination paperwork. Seems it really is about who you get at the counter. Would I do it again? I'm not sure...wish they had a way to prescreen prior to arriving to the airport to reduce the anxiety because once you're at the airport, what do you do if you're denied?\n\n- [![Cheryl](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nCheryl\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/985900)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nDoesn’t allow 2 dogs next to each other\n\n\n\nDelta doesn’t allow 2 dogs to sit next to each other.

My dog carrier won’t fit under the seat… it’s a standard soft sided carrier that works great with other airlines. The life jacket compartment under the seat is what is blocking the space needed. You will have the best luck with an aisle seat, the carrier only sticks out a little so at least you have some legroom. This is was a basic ticket, 1st class might have more room for a carrier as well. I’ve personally had the best fit with Allegiant flights, usually the carrier will fit sideways completely under the middle seat. I’ll add a photo so you can see what I’m talking about, no legroom. For $125 each way, you’d expect that they would actually fit in the seat…\n\n- [![Michelle](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nMichelle\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/781158)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nHorrible\n\n\n\nNowhere in the pet section says that I have to be in the main cabin to fly with a pet.

I purchased the Sherpa Delta medium bag and had all the medical records ready when checking in. The agent had a quick look at the paperwork and did not even check on my dog.\n\nThe aircraft from Memphis to ATL was an MD88 and from ATL to BRU 767-300 (eco comfort seat) we were even allowed to pre-board as i had my dog. Again, nobody on the plane even paid attention to my dog. The bag fitted perfectly under the seats ( window seat) and we had a great trip. My dog slept through even during the landing.

She's a fairly big papillon, 11 lbs and 11 inches at the shoulder, but she's got a SleepyPod Air that can shorten as needed or be extended for more comfort in the terminal. At RDU she got checked in at the counter and they loved her, and also the special services line is super quick compared to the endless bag drop lines. We went past the bomb sniffing dogs and through security no problem. The plane was half empty so other than stowing her under the seat for takeoff she was in the empty seat next to me for the whole flight. And she's a very very relaxed sort of dog, so she didn't make a peep for her entire flight. Now flying home from BOS, the check in lady was concerned she was too big for the carrier (because she's a very fluffy papillon and her fluff was everywhere) but when I told her that she was fine and the vet had approved the carrier she was okay with it. I feel like there should be some sort of way to get a vet-approved-to-fly-in-this-kennel certificate so I don't have to explain that my dog is 60% fur by volume to the lady again. Then we were in line for security and we were halfway through the line when a TSA guy looked at the bag (it looks more like a duffel bag than a dog carrier) and asked \"Is that a dog?\". Then he proceeded to drag us out of line, because apparently she couldn't go past their bomb sniffing dog, and scolded the ladies supervising the beginning of the line and told them that it was a dog and they put us in a special line that went right to the ticket scanners. So skipping the line was nice, but maybe if you're flying make sure to let everyone official know that you're carrying a dog.

They're always trying to find a way to reject you for container, certificate, weather, etc. even though you are within the guidelines (and have shipped with them before.) Apparently their rule is to let the desk have wide latitude despite the written rules. They even tried to reject us on the return trip for improper water container or something when it was the thing Delta Cargo in LA had insisted on. They also used the suspicion of us being breeders as a way to delay and almost miss the plane. In Detroit, the staff went into their glass office to \"inspect the paperwork\". My kids were crying because Delta initially said they wouldn't take the dog. They were literally filing their nails, looking and laughing at us from in there. So not just slow and incompetent, as they are here in LA, but actually mean.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nBrenna\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nGreat Experience with Delta\n\n\n\nAfter reading a lot of these reviews I was nervous about flying from Raleigh/Durham to Seattle with my cat on Delta, but I had a great experience from start to finish. It was easy to make my reservation for my cat by calling Delta, and they told me the exact specifications of the underseat area on the plane I was flying on. This allowed me to buy a cat carrier that I was sure would fit. I arrived at the airport an hour and a half before my flight, but happened to arrive at an extremely busy time with gigantic lines. I went straight to the special services line and they were able to check me and my cat in quickly and easily. I was dreading going through security with my skittish cat, but it all went very smoothly. The cat carrier I bought was a small Original Delux model from Sherpa, and it fit perfectly under the seat in front of me on the airplane. This was my first experience flying with a pet, but Delta made it all very easy.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nAmy\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nGreat for shipping dogs!\n\n\n\nI work with rescues in Atlanta and Seattle to ship puppies and their moms from rescues in Atlanta to Seattle where they are adopted into loving homes. I have literally shipped hundreds of dogs through Delta's pet shipping program and they have all arrived safely with no problem! I even had a pilot text me once to say that he had seen my pups loaded and they were doing great! I was super impressed that he took the time to do that. They also called me once when the pups needed to be put on a later flight and explained that they were being cared for and were doing fine. Delta always treats my pups with great care and I would recommend them to anyone wanting to ship their pets.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nDonna\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nWon't do this again\n\n\n\nWe recently moved across the country and didn't want to subject our cat to 8 days on the road, especially as he could be boarded in a familiar place and they were happy to put him on a plane for us.\n\n\n\nThe people on the phone at Delta Cargo were really great...accommodating and helpful. The problems came when I went to pick him up. First, his flights were delayed by two hours, then four hours. Okay, not great, but I was following his progress via Flighttracker and at least I knew about it.\n\n\n\nThe real problem came when I went to pick him up at Seatte Tacoma airport. There I was told that he had \"been taken off that flight for some reason\" but they couldn't say why, and he was going to be another flight two hours later. Basically their attitude was a big shrug, snottiness, and no information. I then called the national cargo people, who couldn't tell me anything either. I was really upset because he's an older cat and was terrified that he had had a health episode or some other reason.\n\n\n\nI wasn't the only pet owner whose pets experienced the exact same thing...there were six of us in that cargo facility waiting for our pets and getting zero help or reassurance. When he did finally arrive, he was wet with with urine and very hungry and thirsty.\n\n\n\nI thought it was the best of the bad choices but if I had to do it again, I woudn't.\n\n\nLoad More Reviews\n\nLoading…\n\nFailed.\n[Post a Review](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/5/review/)![Bubble](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bubble.svg)\n\nPost a Review\n\n\n## Traveler Photos\n\n\nWe dug up 8 pictures of dogs flying Delta Air Lines.\n\n\n\n![In Carrier](https://photos.bringfido.com/photo/2023/06/13/photo/2023/06/13/quinn_in_carrier_MtKjWox.jpeg?size=block219&density=2x)![Flying or shipping your dog with Delta Air Lines](https://photos.bringfido.com/photo/2023/03/05/photo/2023/03/05/magnoliatheblackshepherd.jpeg?size=block219&density=2x)![Cute dog at the airport about to board the airplane.](https://photos.bringfido.com/photo/2023/03/05/photo/2023/03/05/gouda_doodle.jpeg?size=block219&density=2x)![Doodle flying Delta Air Lines in his carrier.](https://photos.bringfido.com/photo/2023/03/05/photo/2023/03/05/atlchancethepuppy.jpeg?size=block219&density=2x)![Cute dog at the airport with a suitcase next to an airplane](https://photos.bringfido.com/photo/2023/03/05/photo/2023/03/05/delta_candiceparnellphotography.jpeg?size=block219&density=2x)![Dog looking at a Delta Air Lines airplane](https://photos.bringfido.com/photo/2023/03/05/photo/2023/03/05/babythesilky_delta.jpeg?size=block219&density=2x)![Paco at BNA Airport flying Delta Air Lines](https://photos.bringfido.com/photo/2023/03/05/photo/2023/03/05/paco_taco_delta.jpeg?size=block219&density=2x)![Carrier doesn’t fit](https://photos.bringfido.com/photo/2022/03/01/photo/2022/03/01/B9D19E86-0FF6-44F0-A5F0-AAA53A06E183.jpeg?size=block219&density=2x)\n\n\nWant to feature your creature?

Pets are welcome to travel in the cabin and as checked baggage in the hold with KLM.\n\n\n[Visit Website](https://www.klm.com/travel/us_en/prepare_for_travel/travel_planning/pets/index.htm)\n\n\nOr call [(866) 434-0320](tel:+18664340320) for more information.\n\n\nYou can use BringFido to find a [pet friendly place to stay](https://www.bringfido.com/lodging/) at your destination.\n\n\n## Pets in the Cabin\n\nKLM welcomes small cats and dogs into the economy cabin on most of their flights, and in business class on flights within Europe. Dogs are welcome in the cabin if the combined weight of the pet and carrier is under 18 lbs (8 kg). Each passenger is permitted to travel with 1 pet. To bring your cat or dog with you, you’ll pay a fee of EUR 75 to EUR 400 per one-way.\n\n## Pets in Checked Baggage\n\nPets and carriers weighing more than 18 lbs (8 kg) can be transported in the hold with KLM. To travel as checked baggage in the hold, pets and carriers can weigh a maximum 165 lbs (75 kg). Passengers can check up to 3 pets in the hold. If you have a transfer time of more than 3 hours, or your flight is operated with a Boeing 787-9 or 787-10 aircraft, then you are not allowed to travel with a pet in the hold. To bring your cat or dog with you, you’ll pay a fee of EUR 75 to EUR 400 per one-way.\n\n## Pets in Cargo\n\nPets that exceed the maximum weight for traveling in the hold, those traveling alone, or animals that are heading to countries where they require pets to be transported as freight, can all go through Air France-KLM Cargo instead, where animals are shipped with a special cargo agent. Pets and carriers weighing more than 165 lbs (75 kg) or exceeding 115\" (292 cm) in height must travel this way. On some types of aircraft, the kennel must not be larger than 97\" (247 cm). You can contact them directly at 800-556-9000 to find out prices, availability, and conditions for your pet's travel plans.\n\n## Carrier Guidelines\n\nFor animals traveling in the cabin, carriers must be soft-sided and no bigger than 18\" x 11\" x 9\" (46 cm x 28 cm x 24 cm). Pets must be able to stand up and lay down comfortably inside. For pets traveling in the hold, carriers must not exceed the dimensions of 48\" x 32\" x 35\" (122 cm x 81 cm x 89 cm) on KLM flights and 40\" x 27\" x 30\" (102 cm x 69 cm x 76 cm) on KLM Cityhopper flights. Carriers must alsohave a fiberglass or rigid plastic shell, wheels must be removed or blocked with duct tape, the door must have a centralized locking system, and the two parts of the carrier must be joined by bolts. It must be large enough for your pet to stand up without touching the top, turn around easily, and lie down in a natural position.\n\n## Other Restrictions\n\nUnfortunately, snub-nosed breeds are not allowed to travel with KLM. Animals of this type must be transported via KLM Cargo. The following dog breeds are not accepted for travel with KLM: Affenpinscher, American Bully, Boston Terrier, Boxers (all breeds), Bulldogs (all breeds), Bull Mastiff, Cane Corso, Pugs (all breeds), Chow-Chow, Great Dane (all breeds), Certain breeds of Spaniel (Tibetan, Japanese, English, King Charles), Brussels Griffon, Lhasa Apso, Mastiffs (all breeds), Neapolitan Mastiff, Pekingese, Small Brabant, Shih Tzu, Shar Pei, Staffordshire Bull Terrier. The following cat breeds are not permitted: Burmese, Exotic Shorthair, Himalayan, and Persian.\n\n## Reviews\n\nBringFido Guest Rating\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKLM Royal Dutch Airlines has received a rating of 4.0 out of 5 bones by 0 canine critics on BringFido.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/loading.svg)\n\nLoading reviews…\n\nUnable to load.\n\n\n- [![Nele](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/URwVloSPcR/asid10200541726205621height50width50ext1636386933hashAeT8IvGRdaILBIYeRpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nNele\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/847841)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nGreat experience, kind staff\n\n\n\nI flew with my cat in the cabin from Netherlands to Spain.

On both flights the very nice staff reassurede that my dog was indeed on board and that the pressure and the temperature is fine for my dog in the luggage department in the belly of the plane. When I arrived to Mexico I was surprised to see that the kennel of my dog was replaced by a bigger one, to make her feel more comfortable.

Pets are welcome to travel in the cabin and as checked baggage in the hold with KLM.\n\n\n[Visit Website](https://www.klm.com/travel/us_en/prepare_for_travel/travel_planning/pets/index.htm)\n\n\nOr call [(866) 434-0320](tel:+18664340320) for more information.\n\n\nYou can use BringFido to find a [pet friendly place to stay](https://www.bringfido.com/lodging/) at your destination.\n\n\n## Pets in the Cabin\n\nKLM welcomes small cats and dogs into the economy cabin on most of their flights, and in business class on flights within Europe. Dogs are welcome in the cabin if the combined weight of the pet and carrier is under 18 lbs (8 kg). Each passenger is permitted to travel with 1 pet. To bring your cat or dog with you, you’ll pay a fee of EUR 75 to EUR 400 per one-way.\n\n## Pets in Checked Baggage\n\nPets and carriers weighing more than 18 lbs (8 kg) can be transported in the hold with KLM. To travel as checked baggage in the hold, pets and carriers can weigh a maximum 165 lbs (75 kg). Passengers can check up to 3 pets in the hold. If you have a transfer time of more than 3 hours, or your flight is operated with a Boeing 787-9 or 787-10 aircraft, then you are not allowed to travel with a pet in the hold. To bring your cat or dog with you, you’ll pay a fee of EUR 75 to EUR 400 per one-way.\n\n## Pets in Cargo\n\nPets that exceed the maximum weight for traveling in the hold, those traveling alone, or animals that are heading to countries where they require pets to be transported as freight, can all go through Air France-KLM Cargo instead, where animals are shipped with a special cargo agent. Pets and carriers weighing more than 165 lbs (75 kg) or exceeding 115\" (292 cm) in height must travel this way. On some types of aircraft, the kennel must not be larger than 97\" (247 cm). You can contact them directly at 800-556-9000 to find out prices, availability, and conditions for your pet's travel plans.\n\n## Carrier Guidelines\n\nFor animals traveling in the cabin, carriers must be soft-sided and no bigger than 18\" x 11\" x 9\" (46 cm x 28 cm x 24 cm). Pets must be able to stand up and lay down comfortably inside. For pets traveling in the hold, carriers must not exceed the dimensions of 48\" x 32\" x 35\" (122 cm x 81 cm x 89 cm) on KLM flights and 40\" x 27\" x 30\" (102 cm x 69 cm x 76 cm) on KLM Cityhopper flights. Carriers must alsohave a fiberglass or rigid plastic shell, wheels must be removed or blocked with duct tape, the door must have a centralized locking system, and the two parts of the carrier must be joined by bolts. It must be large enough for your pet to stand up without touching the top, turn around easily, and lie down in a natural position.\n\n## Other Restrictions\n\nUnfortunately, snub-nosed breeds are not allowed to travel with KLM. Animals of this type must be transported via KLM Cargo. The following dog breeds are not accepted for travel with KLM: Affenpinscher, American Bully, Boston Terrier, Boxers (all breeds), Bulldogs (all breeds), Bull Mastiff, Cane Corso, Pugs (all breeds), Chow-Chow, Great Dane (all breeds), Certain breeds of Spaniel (Tibetan, Japanese, English, King Charles), Brussels Griffon, Lhasa Apso, Mastiffs (all breeds), Neapolitan Mastiff, Pekingese, Small Brabant, Shih Tzu, Shar Pei, Staffordshire Bull Terrier. The following cat breeds are not permitted: Burmese, Exotic Shorthair, Himalayan, and Persian.\n\n## Reviews\n\nBringFido Guest Rating\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKLM Royal Dutch Airlines has received a rating of 4.0 out of 5 bones by 0 canine critics on BringFido.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/loading.svg)\n\nLoading reviews…\n\nUnable to load.\n\n\n- [![Nele](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/URwVloSPcR/asid10200541726205621height50width50ext1636386933hashAeT8IvGRdaILBIYeRpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nNele\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/847841)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nGreat experience, kind staff\n\n\n\nI flew with my cat in the cabin from Netherlands to Spain.

In Amsterdam this airline has a special dog hotel stop where they feed and water the dog, they let the dog out for potty and even clean the cage if necessary. On both flights the very nice staff reassurede that my dog was indeed on board and that the pressure and the temperature is fine for my dog in the luggage department in the belly of the plane. When I arrived to Mexico I was surprised to see that the kennel of my dog was replaced by a bigger one, to make her feel more comfortable.

Small dogs and cats are also permitted in the cabin on flights to/from Puerto Rico or St. Thomas. Passengers are limited to 1 pet carrier each with up to 2 pets inside. Pets are not permitted on international flights. Spirit Airlines limits the number of pet carriers in the cabin to 4 on routes within the United States, including San Juan, Puerto Rico and St. Thomas.

We had no issues flying round trip from Miami (MIA) to San Juan Puerto Rico (SJU) and back with our dogs in the cabin.\n\n\n\nYou can carry your pet in a carrier onboard along with a personal item (backpack). The pet carrier goes under the seat, and you will have to store your backpack overhead as there is only enough space under the seat for the pet carrier. When booking your flight online using the spirit app there is an option to add pets to your ticket, so you don’t have to call the airline to do anything extra. Each person can carry one pet carrier and the cost is $125 each. You do have to check in formally at the departure agent desk. They don’t ask you to take the dog out of the carrier. Going through security is alright; if you are flying from a busy airport Spirit has an add-on fast security pass you can buy while booking your ticket to let you go through first class/business class security (only specific airports). I have TSA pre check which is helpful.\n\n\n\nYou have to take your dog out of the carrier to go through security. TSA does not have any relation with the airlines so they don’t care what size your dog is. No one checked on our dogs after security. On our flight the person next to us in our row also had a dog! All three dogs did very well and no hassle from the airline.\n\n\n\nA relative of ours has taken two puppies via spirit from Houston (IAH) to Miami (MIA) without issue (in one carrier).\n\n\n\nOverall I think dog owners with dogs that are “borderline” size (you know who you are), you are at the mercy of the airline staff, and this may be airport dependent. I’d encourage other reviewers to post the airports they use so we can all get an idea of which airports have more tolerant staff.\n\n\n\nWe appreciate that Spirit staff are accommodating regarding pet policies and they can expect our continued business when traveling with dogs.\n\n- [![Laurie](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/KnRsZcSdRb/LaurieWilliams.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nLaurie\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1457438)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nKicked off flight AFTER approved at check in!\n\n\n\nAvoid Spirit at all costs.

Carrier (Sherpa) was approved at check in, got my boarding pass, boarded the plane, put carrier under seat THEN flight attendant says my carrier stuck out too far and I wouldn’t be able to fly. They started escorting me off the plane but passengers who saw what they were doing started booing and make a fuss, so they let me sit up front in slightly bigger seats. Carrier still stuck out as far.🤷🏾‍♀️\n\n- [![daniel](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/e0Arl8bvs2/danielmaisonet.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\ndaniel \\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1409675)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nSpirit Airline scam\n\n\n\nPet fee was partially refunded. The other half was posted in a visa card not associated to me. Somehow, Spirit Airlines took my refund for themselves and will not help me resolve this matter. Instead, they are giving me the business, placing fault to a 3rd party, but I know best. I directly book my pet fee through Spirit. It's been over 1 hr on hold to speak to supervisor. He stated he could not help me and refused to reverse the charges since it has been released to what he claim to be a 3rd party. Keep in mind, I made the pet reservation directly through Spirit and not through a 3rd party. The 3rd party has no information about the pet fee at all or any refunds owed to me. In conclusion, never deal with Spirit Airlines when traveling with a pet. They are not your friend. They will take as much money from you if given the opportunity.\n\n- [![Marian](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nMarian\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1253832)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nGreat Experience\n\n\n\nI visited Miami early December & flew with Spirit airlines.

I also used the Sherpa pet carrier size large & it fit perfectly under the seat!\n\n- [![Sabine](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nSabine\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1163460)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nTravel with MyBun\n\n\n\nI recently started traveling with my domestic Bunny on Spirit. What sold me was their reply to pets on the plane: no pets will ever be sent to the cargo. Every person that met him on the plane adored him and treated him with love and care. His pet carrier fit just fine under the seat. He was calm thought out the flight. The Crew was patient and helpful. I have flown 2xs so far (due to work) and have had no issues. Just a pleasant experience.\n\n- [![Lisa](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nLisa\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/639076)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nExcellent experience\n\n\n\nOk, I have read a lot of bad reviews for flying with a pet on Spirit so I want to say my piece here. They were so friendly and easy at the ticket counter. I have a 14 lb Pom terrier mix. His back pack was 18x14x9 which are the requirements for the airplane. They checked us in said hi to my pup and told me all about their fur babies and off we went! Easy and friendly. He fit perfectly under the seat and the stewardesses were so sweet and kind. They definitely don’t deserve all the bad reviews they are getting. We need to post the good stuff too. Also if people are pushing the rules and think they can walk on with a carrier or dog that doesn’t meet the requirements then you can’t except to be accommodated! I also recommend the Mr.Peanut backpack carrier on Amazon. It can lay under the seat and sit upright when not under the seat. It’s sturdy and light with lots of great pockets and padding.\n\n- [![Tasha](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nTasha\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/970722)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nNo hassel\n\n\n\nI flew to Houston Texas from California to get my puppy. My first flight was canceled about 6 hours before departure so I had to cancel the whole trip. I waited a few days and decided to give Spirit another try so I booked again. My first flight there was uneventful. My return flight with the puppy was not so great. I was told to check in at the desk even though I had already been given a electronic boarding pass just for them to print another of the same exact boarding pass. Upon check in I was asked of I was aware of my flight delay and I said no. I was told that my flight was delayed 2 hours. I wasn't happy but proceeded through security to wait at my gate. There was no mention of the puppy on my boarding pass so I asked a Spirit gate if they could confirm my carry on pet which they did. My flight home had delay after delay after 3 different gate changes I was very relieved to get on the plane to head home. I had a very small carrier for my less than 1 pound puppy and placed it under the seat with my small personal backpack and I was very uncomfortable with no space at all. Im only 5'4\" and I had no space to put my feet at all. With the TSA limits of liquids I was only allowed to bring very little wet food for my puppy which didn't last long after several hours of delays for what was supposed to be a 3 hour trip home so I had a cranky puppy. The flight was freezing both there and back not comfortable at all. I was very disappointed in my experience with Spirit and I do not recommend people with pets to choose this airline. There is no space at all. On a positive note the staff was friendly but a friendly staff isn't enough for me to ever fly Spirit again. They are known for their cancelations and delays (I wasn't aware until I was upset and started researching) so consider that as well\n\n- [![Alexis](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/32JytLNOvY/asid10107408173582628height50width50ext1635191364hashAeRroit2KIuAEElnCwE?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nAlexis\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/837353)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nDon’t do it (9/2021)\n\n\n\nI’ve been traveling with my 6 year old doodle since she was 6 months old (for 5 years as an ESA and now as a pet in cabin). She is 15lbs and we use the Sherpa carrier. When I tell you I’ve never, ever had an issue flying with her, I mean it. She’s been on at least 40 flights with me on every airline under the sun. Come today, I was checking in at Spirit for a one way flight and they asked to see her in the carrier, fair. I put her in and zipped it up. The lady then proceeds to tell me because her head touches the top of the carrier when she stands, she cannot fly with me. She suggested I buy a bigger carrier and come back, which doesn’t even makes sense bc a taller carrier wouldn’t fit under the seat. That was it, nothing I could do. They refunded me and I booked a flight a few hours later on delta. No problem. Flew jet blue on the first leg of my trip, also no problem. I don’t understand how her head touching the top of the carrier has any impact on her ability to fly with me. She has plenty of space and can move around freely. Don’t fly spirit with your pet.\n\n- [![Sean](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/431868/asid10221954401942918height50width50ext1606091182hashAeThS6LCfWux88bH9GU?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nSean\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/549289)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nDenied at check-In\n\n\n\nMy 15 week, 15 pound puppy was denied at check-in today, as I was told his carrier was too small for him. His carrier is approved for dogs twice his size. He was sprawled out fully and asleep and they wanted me to wake him up and make him around. They were completely unwilling to work with me and told me even if I got a bigger carrier he couldn’t fly because the carrier would be too big. I had two dogs with me and one is an ESA. I had to go through complete hell to get Spirit to approve her papers even though I submitted 10 days before the flight. DO NOT CHOOSE SPIRIT FOR PETS AND ESA! The first check-in agent told us the carrier was fine and then another one came along and said it was not. This was a case of someone having a bad day and having a power trip to ruin ours. We’ll never fly with Spirit again. We have reported the employees that was dealt with at check-in and I demanded a full refund and got it. If they tell you you cannot get a refund, keep asking for a supervisor and demand it and you will get it. They have the ability to give you your money back if they screw you over so get your money back and choose another airline.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nKatrina\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nPoor service\n\n\n\nVery disappointed with Spirit. Booked my flight online (which didn't ask for pets) so when I called to add him to my ticket they said they could not accommodate my dog due to the 4 pet limit per flight they have. While I 100% understand this rule, I was not aware that they had reached the limit at the time of my booking. They said I can still fly WITHOUT my dog or change my flight and pay for the difference ($150+) in addition to the pet in cabin fee ($110) in addition to my original flight cost ($139). I had also originally paid extra to select my seat and lost that payment with the flight change- couldn't even get a refund! Very unfortunate being as I would have gone with another airline had I known I would have to pay this!!

    "markdown": "# Airline Pet Policies\n\nPlanning to fly with your dog? While air travel can be a quick way to get Fido from one place to another, you should know that every airline has different rules about transporting pets. Some allow small dogs to travel in the aircraft cabin as part of your carry-on luggage allowance, while others will only allow pets to travel in the cargo area, and fees can vary from nothing at all to more than $500. Also, most airlines only allow one or two dogs on each flight, so always make sure a “seat” is available for your dog BEFORE buying your own ticket.\n\n\nTo take off without a hitch, please read our [Ten Tips for Flying with Fido](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/top_10_tips/), and familiarize yourself with current [U.S. Travel Regulations](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/us_regulations/) or [International Pet Travel](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/international/) restrictions before you go.

    "markdown": "# Airline Pet Policies\n\nPlanning to fly with your dog? While air travel can be a quick way to get Fido from one place to another, you should know that every airline has different rules about transporting pets. Some allow small dogs to travel in the aircraft cabin as part of your carry-on luggage allowance, while others will only allow pets to travel in the cargo area, and fees can vary from nothing at all to more than $500. Also, most airlines only allow one or two dogs on each flight, so always make sure a “seat” is available for your dog BEFORE buying your own ticket.\n\n\nTo take off without a hitch, please read our [Ten Tips for Flying with Fido](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/top_10_tips/), and familiarize yourself with current [U.S. Travel Regulations](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/us_regulations/) or [International Pet Travel](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/international/) restrictions before you go.

However, we had an absolutely AWFUL experience today. Apparently, Hawaiian Airlines had updated their policy to require that dogs flying in-cabin must be able to stand in an upright manner (their heads held at neutral, above-body height) while in their carrier. With a carrier height restriction of a measly 9.5\", this is impossible for most dogs. When we called to reserve a spot for our dogs, we were only told the usual (i.e. carrier and weight limitations, and that dogs must be able to comfortably turn around and lie in their carrier). When we tried to check in with an agent at the guest services counter, she immediately glared at us and told us that she won't allow our dog on the plane. She was completely unsympathetic, unfriendly, and unhelpful. Her only solution was to leave and come back with a hard-sided carrier to throw her in cargo. After debating for some time, we just left and ran into another agent who was able to assist us and was extremely apologetic. Furthermore, the first agent almost denied entry for our tiny 8 pound dog! I completely understand that dogs should not be stuffed into a carrier without any space to move, but their new policy is way too strict. Just be warned that you may be denied entry if you encounter the wrong guest agent!\n\n- [![Summer](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/ZrBJhx36l8/SummerDien.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nSummer\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1582956)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nHawaiian Airlines new pet carrier policy doesn’t make sense\n\n\n\nI flew from Maui OGG to Kauai LIH with my cat and she was taller than 9.5” (which is the max height for the soft sided pet carrier) and they were giving me a hard time because she couldn’t stand in her carrier. But not many cats can with that height restriction. I even had my friend bring a hard carrier for the cargo section but it was still too small. Their policy is obviously do not take into consideration the size of pets. Hawaiian Airlines was not very helpful And just shrugged and told me that rules are rules. But they let me go with the exception that when I fly back to Maui that I would get a new carrier for her.\n\n- [![Betty](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nBetty\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1468081)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nNew requirements are impossible\n\n\n\nThe max size carrier of 16\" x 10\" x 9.5\" are impossible, because I cannot find a carrier that isn't at least 17\"! Before this was never a problem, but now with the new requirements I almost got turned away when taking my cat to the vet the other day. The gate agent at Kona was very curt, brought out a tape measure, told me I couldn't bring her in the cabin! I eventually was let onto the plane, but not until after a lot of back-and-forth. If there is a carrier that anyone knows of that fits their requirement for size, PLEASE share!\n\n- [![M](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/CcC2bS29J3/M.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nM\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1444550)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nQuarantine employees in Oahu\n\n\n\nReminded me of DMV employees.

Luckily my wife is skilled at working with entitled people as a hotel front desk agent. She was able to stroke the lady’s egos just enough to get our dogs processed in time. We almost missed our connecting flight to Maui from California because the quarantine employees seemed to have some office drama going on between them.

At the Services desk, where one needs to check in with a pet, I was immediately denied because the agent said my 12 pound dog could not comfortably stand in his soft-sided kennel. Mind you, this is a regulation-size soft sided kennel in which he travels to and from Boston on two 6-hr legs usually via Seattle on excellent Alaska Airlines. We make the round trip twice annually and use the very kennel in which he arrived to HNL on a Hawaiian flight 51 hours ago. Speaking of his fellow Kona-based HA agents he said “they were wrong” to allow me to depart Kona, that there were new rules implemented on June 1 and, other than presenting a printed sheet of paper showing Hawaiian’s new policy, was unwilling to assist me. Distressed and nearly furious, I awaited another agent who at least had the good sense to contact a supervisor. About 30 minutes later (!) a supervisor named Wendy approached, apologized for her delay, explained the policy and allowed me to check in. The new policy apparently does not allow a pet whose head would extend above the carrier when unzipped to travel in the cabin. So you might be able to travel with a 5 pound Chihuahua or heavier low-slung dog. If this BringFido site still shows the image of a small, bright-eyed white canine with its head extending through its soft-sided kennel then BEWARE of travel on Hawaiian with any pet similar in size. My little guy is smaller than that and we almost got stranded at HNL, trying only to return home on a 49 minute flight.\n\n- [![Susan](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/895002/asid481959382342968height50width50ext1557607594hashAeTPlxNUUaPpGfZn?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nSusan\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/177529)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nHassled every time in Oahu\n\n\n\nI have traveled many times with my Dogue De Bordeaux as a service dog and know all the rules and paperwork required....Hawaiian Airlines in Kona and Hilo and Seattle are wonderful...every time I have to go through Oahu even on inter’-island they are rude and try to tell me why my dog cannot go on the airplane....inter-island Oahu asked for my paperwork...the only thing they are allowed to ask me is does my dog provide a service and what that is...This time I got right in her face and all of a sudden my dog was allowed through without them needing anything...interesting. Once I came through Seattle to Oahu and on to Kona and here they go again at H.A. Oahu counter. This supervisor had me in tears trying to refuse me because my letter was on the doctor’s prescription pad instead of letterhead...wow, really? Seattle didn’t mind, no one else ever had a problem with it ever....This woman was horrible...another woman at the counter came up to me and said if I just wouldn’t have shown the letter, they would have allowed me through...Really?? Incredible...\n\nI love flying Hawaiian Airlines and will continue to do so now that I know their game in Oahu\n\n- [![Derek](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nDerek\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/105509)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nGreat expirence\n\n\n\nWhile vacationing on Kauai last February we adopted \"Shamu\" our 4 year old black lab... Little did we know when adopting him that nobody would fly him back to Massachusetts for us.... except Hawaiian. We flew Shamu home via cargo and he was just fine!\n\n\n\nThe Humane Society was incredibly helpful in ensuring that we had all the correct paperwork for Shamu - but made one small mistake on his medical sheet. It wasn't a huge problem they quickly drew us up a new one and we ran over to get it (Only a few miles away).\n\n\n\nIf you make sure you get to your flight early and you have the proper paperwork easy peasy!\n\n\n\nI attached a nice little letter introducing himself to the airline staff and a little bag of candy for them as well. They treated our boy with much aloha and he had a great flight home.\n\n\n\nThe only caution I will give is if you are flying your dog into a cold climate... BEWARE! You MUST watch the weather reports like a hawk or your dog may not fly.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nHikari\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nNot Pet Friendly\n\n\n\nFiled a federal complaint against Hawaiian. I flew 3 different carriers with my pet and Hawaiian, the 4th carrier gave me the MOST problems. I checked in 3 hours before my flight from San Diego to Honolulu and they made me wait 2 hours while they went to process authorization. They then said they would make an exception and let me fly. I should have made them not make the exception as the Federal complaint was excused because the airline did allow me to fly. Big deal, they just got away with discrimination and will continue to do this over and over again. I guess they truly don't want to accept pets and if so, them they should just NOT do it.\n\n\n\nAlso, it is NOT Hawaii Quarrantine that doesn't allow the pets in the cabin as many are told. It is the AIRLINES who are refusing to allow the pets in cabin into Hawaii. Kudos to ALASKA AIR. They have no become my go to airline!!\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nAnna\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nNo wagging tails\n\n\n\ndesk lady asked how old my pet was and before I could say the month she insiseded on calling the supervisor saying my dog wasn't old enough.

I have tried very hard to speak with their public relations/customer service people at corporate to try to change this, but they absolutely will not respond. The people you get on the phone when you call their 800 number simply say it is \"Hawaii State Law\". I tried to explain to them that the Hawaii State Department of Agriculture told me directly that is not true. Although, you must go through a tremendous amount of red tape, the requirement to place the dogs in cargo coming into Hawaii is Hawaiian Airlines rule, not the state's. Alaska Airlines does allow small dogs to fly in the cabin with you coming into Hawaii. I hate to change Airlines, but my babies are too important to put through that kind of trauma.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nCheryl West\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nTerrified\n\n\n\nAfter the tremendous amount of paperwork Hawaii requires to bring your dog you would certainly expect Hawaiian Aire to accommodate travelers with their beloved pets.

I purchased a Noa pass which allows me 60 segments for the same price at anytime. I rarely know exactly when I fly and purchased the pass so I didn't have to deal w chance fees or hikes in last minute prices. I usually book my ticket 3 or 4 hrs prior to leaving.\n\nFlying w my dog is not a problem leaving honolulu. I usually call in to notify them I will be flying w her the moment I get my ticket. At the counter in honolulu, they follow procedure and do the checklist for my letter. I also make a copy for them so they don't have to go in the back to make a copy. They approve the letter, because I got it written exactly how they want it (that process is a whole other story) and they send me on my way.\n\nHowever, on Maui, they have consistently given me issues. They take my letter in the back and review it for over 20 mins leaving me w no one to talk to. They then say they need to review it w their supervisors and send the letter to someone up top. Honolulu does not to this, their staff are trained to process the letter. They are rude on maui. They tell me I need to not only call but also send in a copy of the letter 48 hrs in advance. This is not possible for people who travel frequently between islands and often book their flight only a fews hrs in advance. Further, sometimes I do not have access to a scanner or fax machine for the couple days I'm on maui. Everytime I'm on maui, the rude staff mention this woman Kristen Foster who apparently makes all these ridiculous rules and makes it a headache for people who travel w pets. I'm not sure why she is involved so much on maui, yet I never hear her name on oahu. I've heard other reviews where she has made life very difficult for people to fly w pets. Honest people, who are trying to follow the rules (which constantly chance) should not be treated this way. It is obvious that hawaiian airlines is trying to discourage people from flying w pets. Further, this ridiculous policy that they have come up w is not mandated by the federal government. I have flown on island air and they happily let my emmotional support dog on the plane w out any documentation and they also didn't even try to charge me. There is no one to talk to at hawaiian airlines about this issue. You are at the mercy of the staff at the check in desk. Even when u get your ducks in a row and follow their procedures, they come up w something else. This complaint is only directed at the staff at maui airport and this woman Kristen foster. Honolulu staff have been nothing but professional and kind. I hope hawaiian airlines looks into the rude behavior and irrational policies coming from the maui staff and Kristen foster.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nCelia\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nNot accomodating Pet\n\n\n\nI was to travel Alaska originally which had electrical problems. They purchased a ticket on Hawwaiian to accommodate me with my 4 lb chuahua. I was attempting to make my schedule with quarantine on a direct release from Las Vegas to Kahului HI. After I ran clear to the other end of the terminal the representatives would not let me on w/o a certificate from my Dr. stating I had special needs/assistance. in order for Zorro to ride in the cabin with me. I'm not impressed now that I read there policy and it states he could have flown with a $175 charge. Instead I ran back to Alaska which was great in the end. My poor dog was stuck in his kennel w/o bathroom from 4:45 AM LV time to 11:30 PM LV time when we arrived in Kahalui 8:30 PM. It just wasn't right.\n\nI showed all my paperwork for the 5 day or direct release program which should have sufficed.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nmike richards\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nHappy, happy ,happy\n\n\n\nI found the Hawaiian Airlines employees to be very friendly and helpful , I shipped my 106 lb. bull mastiff thru their cargo dept. from Seattle to Honolulu.

This is why i am writing another review if it keeps anyone else from going what we went through its worth it. My dogs flight from Seattle to Hilo was 16 hours. When i got to Oahu i ended up with a 5 hour wait to go to Hilo I tried to bump my dog to a earlier flight and was told i could. Was told to get a big cart and bring him from agriculture to the counter, after looking for a half hour for the cart only to be told i was that i could not use them, went back to tIcket counter only to have a new employee there who told me i could not bump him up and wanted to know who told me that. I explained that the previous employee told me, she wanted to know the persons name ( i did not know) she then told she me she could not help me but called a supervisor and tha'ts when things went very downhill. I wanted her to try and reach cargo as they were closed on the weekend ( which it was ) she would not and told me my dog was not flying from Oahu to Hilo in baggage because no dogs do. At that time i told her i was booked to Hilo through cargo and she wanted proof, cargo does not give you inter Island paperwork till you arrive at cargo so i had nothing to show her for the second half of the flight to Hilo. I think at this point she thought I was lying as she became rude, and nasty. she told me if i thought my dog was flying cargo than i should go there. I asked her where cargo was and she said at cargo i then again asked her where cargo was and she again nastily said at cargo, i then where is cargo located and she raised her voice and said at cargo. As i was walking away a employee whispered to me its on Elliott st. I then spent then next hour trying find a place to stay for the weekend in Oahu ( since the supervisor told me my dog was not flying and it was the weekend and when you call cargo it said it was closed ) could not find any opening to stay that would take a dog. I then called my husband in Hilo in tears telling him that i was more than likely going to rent a van and spend the weekend in a parking lot with our dog till i could talk to someone at cargo on monday. I then called a taxi and the driver was incredible he could tell i was very distressed and i told him what was happening and he told me dogs fly out of cargo all the time to Hilo and that cargo was open for dogs going out. He also told me that if for some reason they were not open he would help me so i did not have to sleep in a rented van. He also took my dog to a dog park so he could get out of his kennel for a short time. He took me to cargo and they were expecting and waiting for my dog and yes my dog was flying in baggage to Hilo just like I told the supervisor at Hawaiian. I paid $816.00 for my dog to fly from Seattle to Hilo and were abused for that money. Saddest of all was that the Hawaiian supervisor could have reached cargo and it would have been cleared up instead she chose not to help me and on top of it treat me very rudely. I complained to Hawaiian airline and they came back and said it was a misunderstanding and gave me 1000 miles. No apology for the treatment i received from her. we no longer fly Hawaiian. We own property on the big island and now use Alaska Airlines and its only $100 dollars each direction for your pet to fly, it goes in baggage not cargo. They allow you to put you dog on right before the flight, no 3 hours early in cargo ( which is just plain cruel. A vet meets us in Kona and inspects our dogs paperwork and then we drive to Hilo. I do not think Hawaiian should be allowed to fly pets especially when they are unwilling to help you if there is a problem. More than anything i am glad our dog survived, he was so traumatized it was horrifying. i do not want anyone to go through what we went through.It was one of the most traumatizing thing I have been through. I take responsibilty for using Hawaiian cargo and learned a hard lesson from it never again. We even canceled our Hawaiian credit card.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nLila\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nVery Pleased\n\n\n\nOn our move to Hawai with our dogs, Hawaiian was very Helpful. When we boarded we told the flight attendant that we had 2 dogs in cargo. He went to check that they were boarded, then went to check himself. They were under the pilots where the fresh air comes in and they kept the light on for them. When we got them from the animal office -they were ready for release as soon as we landed, got our bags and got to the office. They were very helpful in making our and our dogs flights very comfortable.\n\n\nLoad More Reviews\n\nLoading…\n\nFailed.\n[Post a Review](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/15/review/)![Bubble](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bubble.svg)\n\nPost a Review\n\n\n## Traveler Photos\n\n\nWe haven‘t received any photos of dogs flying Hawaiian Airlines yet.\n\n\n\n\nWant to feature your creature?

    "markdown": "# Airline Pet Policies\n\nPlanning to fly with your dog? While air travel can be a quick way to get Fido from one place to another, you should know that every airline has different rules about transporting pets. Some allow small dogs to travel in the aircraft cabin as part of your carry-on luggage allowance, while others will only allow pets to travel in the cargo area, and fees can vary from nothing at all to more than $500. Also, most airlines only allow one or two dogs on each flight, so always make sure a “seat” is available for your dog BEFORE buying your own ticket.\n\n\nTo take off without a hitch, please read our [Ten Tips for Flying with Fido](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/top_10_tips/), and familiarize yourself with current [U.S. Travel Regulations](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/us_regulations/) or [International Pet Travel](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/international/) restrictions before you go.

Carriers must alsohave a fiberglass or rigid plastic shell, wheels must be removed or blocked with duct tape, the door must have a centralized locking system, and the two parts of the carrier must be joined by bolts. It must be large enough for your pet to stand up without touching the top, turn around easily, and lie down in a natural position.\n\n## Other Restrictions\n\nUnfortunately, snub-nosed breeds are not allowed to travel with KLM.

In Amsterdam this airline has a special dog hotel stop where they feed and water the dog, they let the dog out for potty and even clean the cage if necessary. On both flights the very nice staff reassurede that my dog was indeed on board and that the pressure and the temperature is fine for my dog in the luggage department in the belly of the plane. When I arrived to Mexico I was surprised to see that the kennel of my dog was replaced by a bigger one, to make her feel more comfortable.

If your journey includes one or more connections, the rate is calculated based on your country of departure and your final destination.\n\n## Pets in Checked Baggage\n\nPets weighing between 17-165 lbs (8-75 kg) can be transported as checked baggage on Air France flights. Each passenger can transport 3 animals per flight. The fee for pets traveling in the hold on flights to Metropolitan France is 100 EUR; within the Caribbean is 200 EUR; in Europe or between Europe and North Africa is 200 EUR; between metropolitan France and Cayenne, Fort-de-France, Pointe-à-Pitre, and Saint-Denis de la Réunion is 200 EUR; and all other flights is 400 EUR.

For more information and prices, you can email Air France Customer Service at mail.servicedeskus@airfrance.fr\n\n## Carrier Guidelines\n\nFor pets traveling in the cabin, carriers must not exceed the dimensions of 18\" x 11\" x 9\" (46 cm x 28 cm x 24 cm). Air France recommends that you use a flexible bag for your own comfort during the flight. The bag must be well-ventilated, big enough for Fido to stand up and turn around, but also fit in the area underneath the seat in front of you. For pets traveling as checked baggage, the size of carriers depends on your pet, but the carriers must have at least 2\" (5 cm) of room above the head. Pets must be able to stand upright without touching the sides and have room to turn around. Carriers must be made of hard plastic or fiberglass, have no wheels, be able to lock in two places, and have separate food and water dishes.\n\n## Other Restrictions\n\nAir France does not allow snub-nosed animals (such as pugs, boxers, bulldogs and Shih Tzu dogs, or Persian and Burmese cats) to travel in the hold for medical reasons. Second category dogs are allowed on cargo flights only. These breeds include Staffordshire Terriers with pedigree, American Staffordshire Terriers with pedigree, Tosas with pedigree, and dogs with morphological characteristics similar to Rottweilers, with or without pedigree. Pets must be at least 15 weeks old and have all required vaccines certified with a European passport to travel with Air France. Any dog or cat traveling within the European Union must be identified with an electronic microchip.\n\n## Reviews\n\nBringFido Guest Rating\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAir France has received a rating of 1.8 out of 5 bones by 0 canine critics on BringFido.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/loading.svg)\n\nLoading reviews…\n\nUnable to load.\n\n\n- [![Jessica](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/v7VupxKsE2/JessicaShops.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nJessica\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1655683)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nAir France doesn’t care about your pet\n\n\n\nIf they did, they wouldn’t sledge us with a 127% price increase from 55 to now 125€.

To travel with your pet in cabin in continental Europe is €125 each way N into into the United States it’s another €200 each way. Last year I was able to travel with my dog for €250 from Paris to New York, I still thought it was quite high since I would normally pay €50 within Continental Europe. But now the fees have gone way up and cost around €400. You also have to think about another hundred euros to get all the certificates from the vet before traveling. I would highly recommend you to look at other airlines who have a more decent fair like AirEuropa and Lacompaingne.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nMike\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nExcellent service\n\n\n\nHave flown 3 times across the atlantic with them with my 80 lb dog in his Verikennel Giant (series 700 crate). They could not have been nicer, friendlier or more efficient in handling our needs. They don't go in cargo, but in a heated luggage compartment below the passenger deck. They have great rates too, just $200 each way. Compare that to a us transcontinental fare of 525 - 850 on US domestic carriers, and you see what a bargain that is.

    "markdown": "# Ten Tips for Flying with Fido\n\n\n\n\nTaking his first flight can be a somewhat traumatic experience for a dog that’s used to sticking his head out the car window and enjoying the sights along the way. After all, his view just won’t be the same from underneath the seat in front of you, or even worse, from the cargo hold. But getting there can still be half the fun if you follow the ten tips below and make sure you’re familiar with the [Airline Pet Policy](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/), restrictions on [Pet Travel in the US](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/us_regulations/), and any additional [International Pet Travel](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/international/) restrictions at your destination.\n\n\n## 1\\. Book early\n\nMost airlines only allow one or two dogs on each flight, so it’s important to book your dog’s ticket as soon as possible. Don’t buy your ticket until you call the airline and make sure there is a “seat” available for your dog on the flight. Once the agent has confirmed availability, reserve both your seats on the same ticket while you’re still on the phone with the agent.\n\n\n## 2\\. Fly direct\n\nBook a non-stop, direct flight whenever possible and try to fly on a weekday when airports are typically less hectic. If your pet will be traveling in the cargo hold, it’s best to fly in the morning or evening during the summer, and midday during the winter to avoid extremely hot or cold temperatures.\n\n\n## 3\\. Visit the veterinarian\n\nMake an appointment with your pet’s veterinarian for a check-up and make sure all vaccinations are up to date. Obtain a health certificate from your veterinarian dated within 10 days of departure. For travel outside the continental United States, additional planning and health care requirements may be necessary. Visit our International Pet Travel or contact the foreign office of the country you are traveling to for more information.\n\n\n## 4\\. Buy a carrier\n\nWhether your dog is a Chihuahua or a Great Dane, there’s a pet carrier to match. Carriers are available in both hard-sided and soft-sided. Soft-sided carriers are more suitable for carry-on and tend to fit better under the seat, but they’re only permitted in the cabin only. To make sure the carrier will fit under the seat on your flight check the size restrictions of the airline in our Airline Pet Policies section. If your dog will be traveling in the cargo hold, purchase a hard plastic carrier with holes for ventilation instead. Carriers must be big enough for your dog to stand, turn around, and lie down comfortably. If the carrier does not permit him to do this, the airline will refuse transport.\n\n\n## 5\\. Can I see some ID, ma’am?\n\nAfter you’ve purchased an appropriate carrier, write your dog’s name on it and include identification tags with your home address and phone number as well as the address and phone number of someone who can be reached at your destination. Carry a current photograph of your pet as well. If he’s lost during the trip, a photograph will make it much easier for airline employees or the local authorities to search effectively. You might also want to consider a permanent form of id (such as a microchip or tattoo) that will increase the likelihood of reuniting with your dog if he gets lost on the trip.\n\n\n## 6\\. Take a test drive\n\nAnimals travel under less stress when they are accustomed to their carrier before they travel. In the weeks prior to your trip, put your dog in his carrier as often as possible for trips around town.\n\n\n## 7\\. Eat, drink, poop, then play\n\nSince a full stomach might be uncomfortable for your dog during travel, we recommend feeding him about four hours before the flight, if possible. While it’s best to refrain from feeding your dog right before the flight, you can (and should) continue to give him water right up to the time of travel. Just be sure to empty the dish before checking in so it doesn’t spill during the flight. If you’re checking the dog, leave the dishes in the carrier so an airline employee can provide your pet with food and water in the event of an extended delay before or after your flight. You should also exercise your pet and let him use the facilities (i.e. grass) before heading to the airport.\n\n\n## 8\\. Arrive early\n\nArrive at the airport early, but not too early, and have your dog’s health certificate handy. You will not be allowed to check your pet in more than four hours before the flight. Most airlines recommend arriving two hours before your flight when traveling with a pet. Passengers with pets must check-in at the counter; curbside and self service check-in are not allowed.\n\n\n## 9\\. -Don’t- take a Valium\n\nWe don’t mind if you take a Valium before the flight, but don’t give your pet tranquilizers just because you’re nervous. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, in most cases, dogs should not be given sedatives or tranquilizers prior to flying because they can create respiratory and cardiovascular problems as the dog is exposed to increased altitude pressures. They can also alter the animal’s natural ability to balance and maintain equilibrium, which can be dangerous when the carrier is moved. While sedation is generally not advised, the decision on whether or not to prescribe a tranquilizer for your pet should be made by your veterinarian. If he or she decides that tranquilizers are medically necessary for the trip, indicate the name of the drug taken and the dosage on the dog’s carrier.\n\n\n## 10\\. You’ve arrived!\n\nWhen you arrive at your destination, go for a long walk before you check in at the hotel. Your dog will feel more comfortable as soon as he sees (and smells) his new surroundings, and realizes that the same rules and boundaries apply here too. By the time you check into the hotel, your dog will already feel right and home and be ready for whatever adventures are in store for him that week.\n\n\n* * *\n\n## Packing List\n\nDon’t forget these items when packing your dog’s suitcase:\n\n\n- Health certificate and medical records\n- Contact information for your regular veterinarian and an emergency contact at your destination\n- Comb, brush, and flea control products\n- Any special medication your dog might need\n- Spare collar with id tag\n- Pet wipes or grooming products\n- Paper towels and stain remover\n- Enough dog food and treats for the entire trip\n- Plenty of bottled water (a sudden change can upset your dog’s stomach)\n- Food and water dishes\n- Leash and poop bags\n- Your dog’s favorite toy and blanket\n- A list of [dog friendly restaurants](https://www.bringfido.com/restaurant/) and [attractions](https://www.bringfido.com/attraction/) at your destination\n\n\nYour Privacy\n\n\nWe use cookies to deliver our services, personalize content, and get feedback on how people use BringFido so that we can improve.\nBy clicking OK, you accept this as outlined in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.bringfido.com/privacy/#cookies).\n\n\nOK\n\n[iframe](https://www.bringfido.com/google/onetap/)",

However, we had an absolutely AWFUL experience today. Apparently, Hawaiian Airlines had updated their policy to require that dogs flying in-cabin must be able to stand in an upright manner (their heads held at neutral, above-body height) while in their carrier. With a carrier height restriction of a measly 9.5\", this is impossible for most dogs. When we called to reserve a spot for our dogs, we were only told the usual (i.e. carrier and weight limitations, and that dogs must be able to comfortably turn around and lie in their carrier). When we tried to check in with an agent at the guest services counter, she immediately glared at us and told us that she won't allow our dog on the plane. She was completely unsympathetic, unfriendly, and unhelpful. Her only solution was to leave and come back with a hard-sided carrier to throw her in cargo. After debating for some time, we just left and ran into another agent who was able to assist us and was extremely apologetic. Furthermore, the first agent almost denied entry for our tiny 8 pound dog! I completely understand that dogs should not be stuffed into a carrier without any space to move, but their new policy is way too strict. Just be warned that you may be denied entry if you encounter the wrong guest agent!\n\n- [![Summer](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/ZrBJhx36l8/SummerDien.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nSummer\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1582956)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nHawaiian Airlines new pet carrier policy doesn’t make sense\n\n\n\nI flew from Maui OGG to Kauai LIH with my cat and she was taller than 9.5” (which is the max height for the soft sided pet carrier) and they were giving me a hard time because she couldn’t stand in her carrier. But not many cats can with that height restriction. I even had my friend bring a hard carrier for the cargo section but it was still too small. Their policy is obviously do not take into consideration the size of pets. Hawaiian Airlines was not very helpful And just shrugged and told me that rules are rules.

At the Services desk, where one needs to check in with a pet, I was immediately denied because the agent said my 12 pound dog could not comfortably stand in his soft-sided kennel. Mind you, this is a regulation-size soft sided kennel in which he travels to and from Boston on two 6-hr legs usually via Seattle on excellent Alaska Airlines. We make the round trip twice annually and use the very kennel in which he arrived to HNL on a Hawaiian flight 51 hours ago. Speaking of his fellow Kona-based HA agents he said “they were wrong” to allow me to depart Kona, that there were new rules implemented on June 1 and, other than presenting a printed sheet of paper showing Hawaiian’s new policy, was unwilling to assist me. Distressed and nearly furious, I awaited another agent who at least had the good sense to contact a supervisor. About 30 minutes later (!) a supervisor named Wendy approached, apologized for her delay, explained the policy and allowed me to check in. The new policy apparently does not allow a pet whose head would extend above the carrier when unzipped to travel in the cabin. So you might be able to travel with a 5 pound Chihuahua or heavier low-slung dog. If this BringFido site still shows the image of a small, bright-eyed white canine with its head extending through its soft-sided kennel then BEWARE of travel on Hawaiian with any pet similar in size. My little guy is smaller than that and we almost got stranded at HNL, trying only to return home on a 49 minute flight.\n\n- [![Susan](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/895002/asid481959382342968height50width50ext1557607594hashAeTPlxNUUaPpGfZn?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nSusan\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/177529)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nHassled every time in Oahu\n\n\n\nI have traveled many times with my Dogue De Bordeaux as a service dog and know all the rules and paperwork required....Hawaiian Airlines in Kona and Hilo and Seattle are wonderful...every time I have to go through Oahu even on inter’-island they are rude and try to tell me why my dog cannot go on the airplane....inter-island Oahu asked for my paperwork...the only thing they are allowed to ask me is does my dog provide a service and what that is...This time I got right in her face and all of a sudden my dog was allowed through without them needing anything...interesting. Once I came through Seattle to Oahu and on to Kona and here they go again at H.A. Oahu counter. This supervisor had me in tears trying to refuse me because my letter was on the doctor’s prescription pad instead of letterhead...wow, really? Seattle didn’t mind, no one else ever had a problem with it ever....This woman was horrible...another woman at the counter came up to me and said if I just wouldn’t have shown the letter, they would have allowed me through...Really??

We flew Shamu home via cargo and he was just fine!\n\n\n\nThe Humane Society was incredibly helpful in ensuring that we had all the correct paperwork for Shamu - but made one small mistake on his medical sheet.

I flew 3 different carriers with my pet and Hawaiian, the 4th carrier gave me the MOST problems. I checked in 3 hours before my flight from San Diego to Honolulu and they made me wait 2 hours while they went to process authorization. They then said they would make an exception and let me fly. I should have made them not make the exception as the Federal complaint was excused because the airline did allow me to fly. Big deal, they just got away with discrimination and will continue to do this over and over again. I guess they truly don't want to accept pets and if so, them they should just NOT do it.\n\n\n\nAlso, it is NOT Hawaii Quarrantine that doesn't allow the pets in the cabin as many are told. It is the AIRLINES who are refusing to allow the pets in cabin into Hawaii. Kudos to ALASKA AIR.

The people you get on the phone when you call their 800 number simply say it is \"Hawaii State Law\". I tried to explain to them that the Hawaii State Department of Agriculture told me directly that is not true. Although, you must go through a tremendous amount of red tape, the requirement to place the dogs in cargo coming into Hawaii is Hawaiian Airlines rule, not the state's. Alaska Airlines does allow small dogs to fly in the cabin with you coming into Hawaii.

I purchased a Noa pass which allows me 60 segments for the same price at anytime. I rarely know exactly when I fly and purchased the pass so I didn't have to deal w chance fees or hikes in last minute prices. I usually book my ticket 3 or 4 hrs prior to leaving.\n\nFlying w my dog is not a problem leaving honolulu. I usually call in to notify them I will be flying w her the moment I get my ticket. At the counter in honolulu, they follow procedure and do the checklist for my letter. I also make a copy for them so they don't have to go in the back to make a copy. They approve the letter, because I got it written exactly how they want it (that process is a whole other story) and they send me on my way.\n\nHowever, on Maui, they have consistently given me issues. They take my letter in the back and review it for over 20 mins leaving me w no one to talk to. They then say they need to review it w their supervisors and send the letter to someone up top. Honolulu does not to this, their staff are trained to process the letter. They are rude on maui. They tell me I need to not only call but also send in a copy of the letter 48 hrs in advance. This is not possible for people who travel frequently between islands and often book their flight only a fews hrs in advance. Further, sometimes I do not have access to a scanner or fax machine for the couple days I'm on maui. Everytime I'm on maui, the rude staff mention this woman Kristen Foster who apparently makes all these ridiculous rules and makes it a headache for people who travel w pets. I'm not sure why she is involved so much on maui, yet I never hear her name on oahu. I've heard other reviews where she has made life very difficult for people to fly w pets. Honest people, who are trying to follow the rules (which constantly chance) should not be treated this way. It is obvious that hawaiian airlines is trying to discourage people from flying w pets. Further, this ridiculous policy that they have come up w is not mandated by the federal government. I have flown on island air and they happily let my emmotional support dog on the plane w out any documentation and they also didn't even try to charge me. There is no one to talk to at hawaiian airlines about this issue. You are at the mercy of the staff at the check in desk. Even when u get your ducks in a row and follow their procedures, they come up w something else. This complaint is only directed at the staff at maui airport and this woman Kristen foster. Honolulu staff have been nothing but professional and kind. I hope hawaiian airlines looks into the rude behavior and irrational policies coming from the maui staff and Kristen foster.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nCelia\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nNot accomodating Pet\n\n\n\nI was to travel Alaska originally which had electrical problems.

This is why i am writing another review if it keeps anyone else from going what we went through its worth it. My dogs flight from Seattle to Hilo was 16 hours. When i got to Oahu i ended up with a 5 hour wait to go to Hilo I tried to bump my dog to a earlier flight and was told i could. Was told to get a big cart and bring him from agriculture to the counter, after looking for a half hour for the cart only to be told i was that i could not use them, went back to tIcket counter only to have a new employee there who told me i could not bump him up and wanted to know who told me that. I explained that the previous employee told me, she wanted to know the persons name ( i did not know) she then told she me she could not help me but called a supervisor and tha'ts when things went very downhill. I wanted her to try and reach cargo as they were closed on the weekend ( which it was ) she would not and told me my dog was not flying from Oahu to Hilo in baggage because no dogs do. At that time i told her i was booked to Hilo through cargo and she wanted proof, cargo does not give you inter Island paperwork till you arrive at cargo so i had nothing to show her for the second half of the flight to Hilo. I think at this point she thought I was lying as she became rude, and nasty. she told me if i thought my dog was flying cargo than i should go there. I asked her where cargo was and she said at cargo i then again asked her where cargo was and she again nastily said at cargo, i then where is cargo located and she raised her voice and said at cargo. As i was walking away a employee whispered to me its on Elliott st. I then spent then next hour trying find a place to stay for the weekend in Oahu ( since the supervisor told me my dog was not flying and it was the weekend and when you call cargo it said it was closed ) could not find any opening to stay that would take a dog. I then called my husband in Hilo in tears telling him that i was more than likely going to rent a van and spend the weekend in a parking lot with our dog till i could talk to someone at cargo on monday. I then called a taxi and the driver was incredible he could tell i was very distressed and i told him what was happening and he told me dogs fly out of cargo all the time to Hilo and that cargo was open for dogs going out. He also told me that if for some reason they were not open he would help me so i did not have to sleep in a rented van. He also took my dog to a dog park so he could get out of his kennel for a short time. He took me to cargo and they were expecting and waiting for my dog and yes my dog was flying in baggage to Hilo just like I told the supervisor at Hawaiian. I paid $816.00 for my dog to fly from Seattle to Hilo and were abused for that money. Saddest of all was that the Hawaiian supervisor could have reached cargo and it would have been cleared up instead she chose not to help me and on top of it treat me very rudely. I complained to Hawaiian airline and they came back and said it was a misunderstanding and gave me 1000 miles. No apology for the treatment i received from her. we no longer fly Hawaiian. We own property on the big island and now use Alaska Airlines and its only $100 dollars each direction for your pet to fly, it goes in baggage not cargo. They allow you to put you dog on right before the flight, no 3 hours early in cargo ( which is just plain cruel. A vet meets us in Kona and inspects our dogs paperwork and then we drive to Hilo. I do not think Hawaiian should be allowed to fly pets especially when they are unwilling to help you if there is a problem. More than anything i am glad our dog survived, he was so traumatized it was horrifying. i do not want anyone to go through what we went through.It was one of the most traumatizing thing I have been through. I take responsibilty for using Hawaiian cargo and learned a hard lesson from it never again. We even canceled our Hawaiian credit card.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nLila\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nVery Pleased\n\n\n\nOn our move to Hawai with our dogs, Hawaiian was very Helpful. When we boarded we told the flight attendant that we had 2 dogs in cargo. He went to check that they were boarded, then went to check himself. They were under the pilots where the fresh air comes in and they kept the light on for them. When we got them from the animal office -they were ready for release as soon as we landed, got our bags and got to the office. They were very helpful in making our and our dogs flights very comfortable.\n\n\nLoad More Reviews\n\nLoading…\n\nFailed.\n[Post a Review](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/15/review/)![Bubble](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bubble.svg)\n\nPost a Review\n\n\n## Traveler Photos\n\n\nWe haven‘t received any photos of dogs flying Hawaiian Airlines yet.\n\n\n\n\nWant to feature your creature?

Pets are allowed to travel in the cabin and as checked baggage in the hold with Air Canada.\n\n\n[Visit Website](http://www.aircanada.com/en/travelinfo/airport/baggage/pets.html)\n\n\nOr call [(888) 247-2262](tel:+18882472262) for more information.\n\n\nYou can use BringFido to find a [pet friendly place to stay](https://www.bringfido.com/lodging/) at your destination.\n\n\n## Pet Reservations\n\nAfter booking your flight, contact Air Canada Reservations at (888) 247-2262 to register your pet for travel on the same flight as yours. You'll be asked to provide the dimensions of the carrier and the weight and breed of your pet. It is strongly recommended that you register your pet within 24 hours of completing your booking to ensure a spot for Fido.\n\n## Pets in the Cabin\n\nSmall cats and dogs are welcome to travel in the cabin if the combined weight of the pet and carrier is under 22 lbs (10 kg). Only 1 cat or small dog in the cabin is allowed per passenger. Pets count towards the passenger's carry-on allowance and must be stowed under the seat for the duration of the flight. The pet fee for travel in the cabin is $50 USD on domestic flights and $100 USD on international flights.\n\n## Pets in Checked Baggage\n\nCats and dogs are allowed to travel as checked baggage if the combined weight with the carrier does not exceed 100 lbs (45 kg). Each passenger is permitted to travel with up to 2 pets, charged separately, only if fully weaned puppies or kittens from 12 weeks to 6 months can be placed in the same carrier and both animals are of the same species. The pet fee for one-way travel within Canada/US is $105 and for one-way international flights is $270. Air Canada may refuse animals traveling in the hold if temperatures are too high.\n\n## Pets in Cargo\n\nAir Canada Cargo can arrange safe transport of your pet as cargo if your pet does not meet requirements to travel in the cabin or as checked baggage.\n\n## Carrier Guidelines\n\nFor pets traveling in the cabin, the maximum dimensions allowed for carriers vary by the aircraft you'll be traveling on and carriers must be soft-sided on Airbus 223, 319, 320, 321, Boeing 7M8, Business Class of Airbus 333, and Boeing 777, 77L, 77W, 788, 789. For pets traveling in the hold, carriers must not exceed 115\" (292 cm) and must be hard-sided, leak-proof, and big enough to allow your pet to stand, turn around, and lie down comfortably.\n\n## Other Restrictions\n\nIn most cases, your pet must be at least 10 weeks old and fully weaned. You’ll need to arrive a full 30 minutes prior to the recommended check-in time for your flight as you must see an agent at check-in. When traveling with a pet, it is not possible to check in online or at an airport self-service kiosk.\n\nBrachycephalic (short/snub-nosed) dog breeds cannot travel in the baggage compartment because they are susceptible to increased risks of heat stroke and breathing problems. These breeds include Affenpinscher, Boston Terrier, Boxer, Brussels Griffon, Bulldog (all varieties), Chihuahua, English Toy Spaniel, Japanese Chin, Lhasa Apso, Pekingese, Pug (including Chinese Pug), Shar-Pei, Shih zu, Teddy Bear (Zuchon or Shichon), and Tibetan Spaniel.\n\nStrong dog breeds must be transported in a special reinforced container. These breeds and crossbreeds include Caucasian Shepherd Dog, Anatolian Shepherd Dog, Pit Bull (all breeds), Mastiff (all breeds), Rottweiler, Wolf Dog Hybrids, and English Bull Terriers.\n\n## Reviews\n\nBringFido Guest Rating\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/half.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAir Canada has received a rating of 2.4 out of 5 bones by 27 canine critics on BringFido.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nTravelers report that while Air Canada has strict policies regarding pets in the cabin, the airline's staff are generally friendly and accommodating when these policies are followed. Some travelers have experienced issues when their pets did not fully meet the size requirements, but others have had positive experiences flying with their pets on Air Canada.\n\n\nAI-generated from the text of reviews\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/loading.svg)\n\nLoading reviews…\n\nUnable to load.\n\n\n- [![Novina](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nNovina\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nOct. 27, 2024](https://www.bringfido.com/user/2055038)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nTerrible experience! Pup wasn't allowed.\n\n\n\nI have read all the terrible reviews here but unfortunately by the time I did I already booked a non refundable ticket from yyz to yvr. So I decided I would try my luck. But if I were you I wouldn't especially if you're flying out of yyz. Essentially my dog is rejected. The bag fits the dimension I even brought an extra bag just in case. My dog is a 7lb shihpoo. He's absolutely tiny. But they kept claiming his head touch the top of the bag and rejected me. Some Reddit users who works at AC counter claims they reject about 50% of pets. At this rate I would not risk it.\n\n\n\nRight away I booked porter and the difference was day and night. The person at the counter even felt bad I had to buy a very expensive last minute ticket and gave me free checked luggage.\n\n\n\nOn my way back from yvr -> yyz I also already had an AC ticket. That was no problem but I could tell a certain people at the counter would give me problems. I just prayed to every God I would not get them. So you're pretty much in the mercy of the person you check in.\n\n\n\nI will never fly AC again if I'm bringing my pup. Which is too bad because I am used to flying exclusively AC for Aeroplan points. Now they will be my absolute last option.\n\n- [![Cristian](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/jbodEpJyxe/Cristian_Ion.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nCristian\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMay. 21, 2024](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1855806)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nHorrible experience\n\n\n\nI flew a small rescue dog from Europe in the cabin. The stewardesses we're rude, and wouldn't let my dog poke his head out of the holder, despite the fact that it's clearly written in the rules that you are allowed to. When I pointed that out and they actually checked the rules they all of a sudden became very friendly and finally allowed it.... at the end of the flight. I am to blame for flying Air Canada.\n\n- [![Maverick](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/5WFtBbBT1G/Yunah.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nMaverick\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMar. 25, 2024](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1787566)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nThe worst.\n\n\n\nIf I can give negative rating I would. If you're planning on bringing pet in cabin avoid AC at all cost. Take Westjet.\n\nThey are NOT pet friendly. I never had any issue with Alaska airline by far my favourite airline. AC counts pet carrier as your CARRYON LUGGAGE. It is absolutely absurd. How would one tiny dog be equal to a CARRYON LUGGAGE. NOT EVEN THE SAME SIZE NOR DO THEY GO OVERHEAD BIN.\n\nPLEASE TAKE WESTJET if flying Canada domestic.\n\n- [![Pham](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/ZpC0Gk79HN/Pham_Bi.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nPham\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1682852)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nVERY DISAPPOINTED! EXTREMELY HORRIBLE SERVICE.\n\n\n\nIf I can give them a minus rating, I for sure would. I arrived at the airport 3 hours prior to my flight and was waiting in line for myself and my small dog to get check in. One staff came at the line and checked for my flight info. While we were waiting, one of the staff suddenly said the check-in is done, its closed now, and started to blame the rest of us for coming too late. At this time 2 hours remaining before departure. 15 minutes later, one of the staff suddenly came back and said just to hold on and we can continued on check-in. We were then moved to another check in counter while the guy line up behind us was okay to move forward and got check-in already. I was served by one of the old lady of Air canada and she said we came too late and said quote on quote “THERE IS NO WAY I WILL LET YOU IN”. Even though I was told by one of her younger colleagues that I can still check in at this time, but then the old lady insisted on that she didn’t want to do it, while looking at my poor dog whining inside the crate. There was some talkings back and forth between herself, the manager and other young staffs. And I guessed they couldn’t persuade the old lady to let us in, so we had to re-book another flight.\n\nSo a lesson is learned from this horrible experience: NEVER BOOK AIR CANADA if you plan to travel with your pet. If you ever come 2 hours before or 3 hours before, that is too late for them. From the manager who is heavily influenced by the senior strict staff, to the confusing young staffs, all creates a wonderful picture of a horrible airline.\n\nMinus rating for them and I don’t think they even deserve it!\n\n- [![Kaitlin](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/sr24PES8Eh/KaitlinYung.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nKaitlin\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1582838)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nFrequent Doggy Flyer almost denied boarding.\n\n\n\nMy bichon frise-shih tzu mix was almost denied boarding to and from our destination. Buddy has flown from Vancouver to San Francisco, San Diego, and San Jose in cabin MANY TIMES in the past 4 years without any issues before September 2023. He even flew YVR to SFO at the beginning of August 2023 and had no issues. All of a sudden in late August we were checking in for another flight from YVR to SFO and the gate agent said he was too big because he couldn’t stand in his carrier. We said that he was a frequent flyer and that he has been a carry on many times with no issues. The agent said they were being more strict with the guidelines on the Air Canada website and that he should be denied boarding. This happened on the way back to YVR too. The guidelines on the website have always stated stricter rules in comparison to other airlines, but historically it has been up to the agent’s discretion and they have been more relaxed. All of a sudden they are being uptight and we will not be flying Air Canada with Buddy again.\n\n- [![Diana](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/kQwkxkNoFb/DianaRojas.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nDiana\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1556732)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nGreat service\n\n\n\nI recently traveled with my dog (west highland white terrier or westie) in cabin, the little one is around 9.5 kg and we had no issue at all. The staff were more than friendly with her and also found the way to help me with the extra weight of my luggage. My dog was travelling in a flexible backpack, but just in case I had the rigid box with me just in case because at the end the airline instructions are different regarding the weight of the dog, but it wasn’t necessary and they checked it in for free. I had a great flight from France to Canada and return, only the passport vaccine was requested bit nevertheless I had everything they require in the webpage. I saw some bad reviews so I was a bit worried but tuned out extremely well and I’m really happy with the treatment Air Canada provided to us!

It just has to fit the specified carrier dimensions.\n\n- [![Vicki](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nVicki\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/78306)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nAir Canada is the worst!!!\n\n\n\nI used points for a ticket to go see family (luckily only bought a 1 way ticket). After I booked I called to book my dog in cabin only to find out there’s only 9 INCHES of clearance below all the seats in the ENTIRE PLANE!!! At that height you’ll only be able to get a chihuahua or hamster under there. So unfortunately, I had to cancel my flight and rebook elsewhere. In doing so I had to pay $75 to get all the points back or forfeit all the points.\n\n\n\nI stopped flying AC 20 years ago after a previous bad experience with their front desk attendants rudeness and now this time paying to get points back for a flight that didn’t accommodate a small dog is absolutely the last draw. No more! Steer clear!!! Be forewarned!\n\n- [![Maru](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nMaru\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1313138)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nDog in cabin denied\n\n\n\nAll of Agents in check-in at Pearson airport are very strict right now.\n\nThey asked me to pull out dogs out of the carriers then they said the dogs are too big then we were denied boarding.\n\nIf your dogs are above 9inch including head and ears, you should have backup for your trips.\n\nRemember they are now very strict.\n\n- [![Erica](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nErica\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1273709)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nHorrible customer service and not dog friendly\n\n\n\nI have flown with my toy Australian shepherd on both WestJet and American Airlines with no issue but when I got to the check in with air canada, staff told me he was too large for his carrier and could not fly in cabin. Despite the fact that my dog is comfortable in his carrier and jumps in immediately without me asking, I was told that it was inhumane for him to be under the seat and that he would need to fly under the plane. The customer service agent told me that it was more humane for my dog to be separated from his owner under the plane despite the fact he was in a soft sided carrier which is not permitted for dogs going in cargo. Another review also noted that this happened to them. I did not further question the agent about my dog being allowed to fly in cargo in a soft sided carrier because I would never have allowed that but he very much gave me the impression that he did not know that dogs in cargo cannot be in soft sided carriers. In addition, a week after we were supposed to fly it came out that air canada had misplaced a dog flying cargo and the dog was found in the corner of an airport unattended hours after the flight had landed so I’m not sure how this guy thought that my dog sitting at my feet for a one hour flight was inhumane when air canada losing a dog for hours was not but I guess air canada has different rules for logic than the rest of society. The customer service agent was rude and acted as though he knew more about my dog and what was best for him than I did. The only good thing that came from my experience was that I was able to get my money back however I will never be flying with air canada again with or with out my dog. The agents were rude and unhelpful to everyone. Several agents ignored questions from passengers waiting to check in which was extremely unprofessional and even had my dog been allowed I would never fly with them again.\n\n- [![Sharon](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nSharon\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1267495)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nIf I can give 0 stars, I would.\n\n\n\nI will never be flying with Air Canada again with my dog. I do not take the time to write reviews but I am just so horrified by how cruel the flight attendants were to my dog in cabin. My dog was in distraught and panting extremely loud in flight, yet they threatened to not fly unless my dog’s bag had to be zip tied. My dog was freaking out and I was just in shock.\n\n\n\nDo not fly with Air Canada if you plan to have your dog in cabin. I could not imagine having them in cargo would be any better. I have been on many flights with my dog and never have I ever experience such cruel and horrific treatment.\n\n- [![Sue](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nSue\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1232247)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nUnbelievably negative service and customer care\n\n\n\nWe have a 14 pound mini terrier that is 9 inches tall that has flown 14 times with us on Air Canada between Toronto and multiple locations We arrived at the airport on November 12 at 5:30 am and were immediately met with an agent corralling people into lines who approached us by saying “that dog cannot fly”. When we explained that the dog was a regular flyer she responded with “ they can deal with it… not me”. The customer service was quite shocking to us. We eventually got to an agent. The young agent immediately asked us to make the dog stand up in its cage which we did. Another agent walked over and said “ that dogs ears are too tall for the cage”. We explained the dog is a regular flyer but this second agent refused to let the dog fly. Once again we explained that this dog is quite comfie in her cage and is able to turn around, move around and sleep comfortably Honestly if it was up to the young agent we first had we would have been fine and able to fly but the second agent was rude, uncaring and officious. So disappointed with Air Canada. We have been flight pass customers for many years but we will never fly with Air Canada again. Customer service was absolutely terrible and no one had any interest in helping us out at 6:00 am. Their attitude was very much one of ‘we don’t care’ so disappointing after so many years\n\n- [![Sohela](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nSohela\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1232005)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nWonderful Service\n\n\n\nI took my dog on a 2 hour flight in late April, and he was treated so well.

After being denied boarding by the gate agent noted above, I showed up for my rebooked flight with a carrier appropriate for use under the plane as well as my normal in-cabin carrier. I explained everything that happened to the agent at the time, who was super nice and did not see an issue with my pet in the in-cabin carrier. She promptly checked me in with my little guy in cabin and even checked with her supervisor just to be sure who concluded that the carrier was fine (I just ended up checking the big kennel as a bag since I had brought it with me).\n\n\n\nOn the way back, this original gate agent, the poor excuse for a human being, had put notes in the file and cancelled my pet in cabin ticket however once again, when checking in at the airport, I explained the whole situation and the extremely nice and accommodating gate agent checked me in with the pet in the cabin. This is the more consistent experience I had with Air Canada and I can say, while terrible at the time, the one bad experience I had was due to one gate agent who lacks the ability to think and takes joy in making people's lives miserable and not Air Canada as a whole. To paint the whole airline with one brush because of one person's actions would be wrong and misleading. One can only hope this person is called out enough times for her inability to be a decent human being and removed from that organization.\n\n- [![Marla](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nMarla\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1007794)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nTerrible/Horrible/Will never fly again.\n\n\n\nI was recently denied boarding with my dog. She is a 14 lb shitzu / bichon cross and I've been flying with her for the past 10 years. I called to book her on the flight and paid $50 each way. I was asked, at the time , for her weight and the size of her case. I had flown with her in February and didn't have a problem. I was told when denied checking in that she was too big to fly in the cabin(!!!!) and that she had to be able to stand fully and turn around. She is able to turn around, is very happy in her case (I have to pull her out to go through security). I looked at new cases in Florida and it appears that they are measured by the top of a dog's back, not their head. Regardless, because she couldn't stand fully upright in the case, I was denied boarding. I ran to West Jet where there was no problem and in fact larger dogs than mine where allowed on the plane in their cases.\n\n- [![Ashlyn](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nAshlyn\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/887118)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nCargo + Carryon - great service+ amazing staff!!\n\n\n\nI've used both their cargo services and in-cabin for my cat between Toronto and Vancouver.\n\n\n\nDue to a medical emergency after I moved to BC I wasn't able to fly home to get my cat so I decided to use the cargo service.

I thought it was a one-off, but travelling back to Toronto with her as cargo, everyone was just as sweet, very amazed by the service.\n\n\n\nThe initial cargo service was delayed because it was a very hot day.

However , our recent experience with AC Vancouver was horrendous . Now that AC insist on using IPATA agents instead of simply self booking and that is where our saga began . We found 4 IPATA members listed for Vancouver and we started our organising in June for our flights in November . Two never replied , one in the US gave us a ridiculous price so we chose Worldwide Pet transport . We had an initial quote which we thought expensive but thought it was the going rate . We lived very remotely in BC and had several questions about how it would all work. Tried emailing , phoning and even left a message on their \"Emergency\" hotline ( which is an answerphone!!! ). We emailed several times and finally asked for proof that they actually existed ...we haven't been answered since August !!! We finally gave up and found a UK firm Paws who were very helpful and they put us onto a professional transport company Seaair who were easy to deal with and very reassuring . The price was reasonable and they organised the document procedures . Air Canada have a strange policy of not confirming the Pet flight until 10 days prior to flying !! At day 8 Seaair had to call AC to get that confirmation . On the flight date we met a Fedex driver who had all the stickers etc for the pet crate and to present to the Cargo desk. With our little dog locked in and sitting on the counter the Air Canada rep simply pushed the papers back and said they were not the correct documents even although the Air Canada Air waiver Bill was purchased from Air Canada , Dorval!!!! He said we just had to move as there was a queue forming . Uncaring , unsympathetic doesn't quite cut it. Fortunately for us Philip Beck ( the Fedex driver) was also a travel agent and we could never lavish him with enough praise as he negotiated the system for the 45minutes it took for the AC staff to eventually concede that they were wrong and we had to rush to board ourselves. We have never been so stressed and will never use Air Canada in Vancouver again as the staff were uninformed but more importantly showed zero empathy for our pet or our predicament that was caused solely by them.\n\nWE also lodged a complaint to IPATA in the summer and never had a response !!\n\n- [![Mike](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nMike\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/729961)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nThe fee is a ripoff\n\n\n\nAir Canada charges a minimum of $50 to bring your small dog into the cabin AND this uses your normally free carry on baggage allowance... forcing you to pay for a checked bag (or higher fare to include a bag). Really this is a $81.50+ fee.\n\n- [![Natasha](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nNatasha\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/178867)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nTravel embargo dates and temperatures?\n\n\n\nI called Air Canada and Air Canada cargo several times as soon as we found out we were moving to Florida in June. I just found out- as I was about to book the flight for our dog and 2 cats, that there is a travel embargo from May 15 - Sept 30, and that there is a general embargo if temperatures are above 29 degrees celsius.

    "markdown": "# U.S. Pet Air Travel Regulations\n\n\n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulates air transportation of pets within the U.S. and all airlines are required by law to follow the guidelines below. Individual airlines may impose further restrictions or fees for flying with your pet. For the individual policies of each airline, refer to our [Airline Pet Policies](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/) page. If you will be traveling from the Continental United States to Hawaii or a foreign country, please consult our [International Pet Travel](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/international/) page for additional regulations imposed at your destination.\n\n\n## Advance arrangements\n\n- When booking a flight on which you wish to bring your pet, call the airline directly to make the reservation and confirm that there is a space available for your pet on the flight.\n\n- 24 to 48 hours before your flight, it’s a good idea to call the airline and reconfirm that you will be traveling with your pet.\n\n- Advance arrangements are not guarantees that your pet will travel on a specific flight. Airlines reserve the right to refuse transport of an animal for reasons like illness, an improper carrier, or extreme temperatures. Airlines can also refuse carriage of an animal that demonstrates aggressive or violent behavior.\n\n- Animals travel under less stress when they are accustomed to their carrier before they travel. In the weeks prior to your trip, put your dog into his carrier as often as possible for trips around town.\n\n- Please note that pets are not allowed to travel with unaccompanied minors on any airline.\n\n\n## The day of your flight\n\n- The USDA requires that your pet be offered food and water within four hours before you check in. Since a full stomach might be uncomfortable for your dog during travel, we recommend feeding him right at four hours before the flight, if possible.\n\n- While its best to refrain from feeding your dog right before the flight, you can (and should) give him water right up to the time of travel. Just be sure to empty the dish before checking in so it doesn’t spill during the flight. If you’re checking the dog, leave dishes in the carrier so an airline employee will be able to provide your pet with food and water in the event of an extended wait before or after the flight.\n\n- Exercise your pet before leaving for the airport. Carry a leash with you so you can walk your pet before you check in and after you arrive at your destination. This will help your dog calm down prior to and after the flight.\n\n- Arrive at the airport early, but not too early. You will not be allowed to check your pet in more than four hours before the flight. Most airlines recommend arriving two hours before your flight when you’re traveling with your pet. Passengers traveling with pets must check in at the ticket counter. No curbside or self-service check-in is allowed.\n\n\n## Approved pet carriers\n\n- Whether your pet is a Chihuahua or a Great Dane, there is a pet carrier to match. The majority of carriers are made of hard plastic with holes for ventilation. No part of the animal is allowed to protrude from the carrier. As a result, wire carriers are not permitted. Soft-sided carriers are permitted in the cabin only.\n\n- Carriers must be big enough to allow the animal to stand, turn around and lie down comfortably. If the pet carrier does not allow the animal to do this, the airline will refuse transport.\n\n- Carriers must have a solid, leak-proof floor that is covered with a towel, litter, or other absorbent lining for accidents that might occur during transit.\n\n- Carriers must be well ventilated with openings that make up at least 14% of the total wall space. At least 33% of the openings must be located in the top half of the carrier and the carrier must have rims to prevent ventilation openings from being blocked by other cargo.\n\n- Carriers should have either grips or handles, so airline employees don’t have to put their fingers inside and risk being bitten.\n\n- The carrier should contain two empty dishes, for food and water, along with feeding instructions and your signature certifying that your pet was offered food and water within four hours of your flight’s scheduled departure.\n\n- Mark the carrier with your pet’s name and include identification tags with your home address and phone number as well as the address and phone number of someone who can be reached at your destination.\n\n- You should mark “Live Animal” on the top and side of the carrier, with directional arrows indicating the proper position of the carrier.\n\n- Do not put a leash or muzzle with the animal, either inside or attached to the outside of the carrier, during transit.\n\n- Kennels can contain one adult dog. Two puppies will be allowed together if they are eight weeks to six months old, weigh more than 20 pounds each, and are fully weaned.\n\n\n## Health certificates\n\nThe USDA requires that your pet must be at least eight weeks old and fully weaned before traveling. Only pets in good health are permitted to fly. Airlines will not transport animals that are violent, ill, or in physical distress.\n\n\nAll pets crossing state borders, with the exception of guide dogs, are required by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to have a rabies immunization and valid health certificate issued by a licensed veterinarian within 30 days of travel. If your pet is traveling via cargo, or if you are a breeder, dealer, or research facility transporting a dog, the health certificate should be issued no more than 10 days before departure.\n\n\n## Use of tranquilizers\n\nAccording to the American Veterinary Medical Association, in most cases, dogs should not be given sedatives or tranquilizers prior to flying. An animal’s natural ability to balance and maintain equilibrium is altered under sedation, which can be dangerous when the kennel is moved.\n\n\nWhether your dog is flying in the cabin or as a checked pet, he will be exposed to increased altitude pressures. This can create respiratory and cardiovascular problems for dogs which are sedated or tranquilized. Snub-nosed dogs (American Staffordshire Terriers, Boston Terriers, Boxers, Brussels Griffins, Bull Terriers, English/French Bulldogs, English Toy Spaniels, Japanese Chins, King Charles Spaniels, Lhasa Apsos, Pekineses, Pugs, Shar-Peis and Shih Tzus) are especially affected.\n\n\nWhile sedation is generally not advised, the decision on whether to prescribe a tranquilizer for your pet should be made by your veterinarian. If your veterinarian decides that tranquilizers are medically necessary, the name of the drug, the dosage, and how the drug was administered should be indicated on the dog’s carrier.\n\n\n## Extreme weather conditions\n\nExtreme hot and cold temperatures can pose a health risk to pets. In summer, choose early morning or late evening flights. In winter, choose mid-day flights. Whenever possible, book nonstop or direct flights and avoid weekend and holiday travel.\n\n\nIf you are traveling to or from a destination where the temperature is (or is forecast to be) either below 45F or above 85F (75F for snub-nosed dogs), you will need a letter signed by your veterinarian stating that your pet is acclimated to extreme weather. If the temperature is below 20F or above 95F, your pet will likely not be allowed to travel in the cargo area even with a letter of acclimation. And some airlines will not accept snub-nosed dog breeds in their cargo areas at all during the summer months.\n\n\nYour Privacy\n\n\nWe use cookies to deliver our services, personalize content, and get feedback on how people use BringFido so that we can improve.\nBy clicking OK, you accept this as outlined in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.bringfido.com/privacy/#cookies).\n\n\nOK\n\n[iframe](https://www.bringfido.com/google/onetap/)",

    "markdown": "# Airline Pet Policies\n\nPlanning to fly with your dog? While air travel can be a quick way to get Fido from one place to another, you should know that every airline has different rules about transporting pets. Some allow small dogs to travel in the aircraft cabin as part of your carry-on luggage allowance, while others will only allow pets to travel in the cargo area, and fees can vary from nothing at all to more than $500. Also, most airlines only allow one or two dogs on each flight, so always make sure a “seat” is available for your dog BEFORE buying your own ticket.\n\n\nTo take off without a hitch, please read our [Ten Tips for Flying with Fido](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/top_10_tips/), and familiarize yourself with current [U.S. Travel Regulations](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/us_regulations/) or [International Pet Travel](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/international/) restrictions before you go.

You’ll find an overview of bringing Fido to many popular international destinations below. No matter where you’re going, you should contact the embassy or consulate of the destination country to confirm pet travel regulations, obtain all of the necessary paperwork (such as health certificates and documentation) regarding your pet’s travel, and contact your local veterinarian to ensure your pet is in compliance with foreign health regulations.\n\n\n\nFinally, don’t forget to check regulations on bringing Fido back to your home country too. Quarantine rules may apply even if your dog has only been gone a short time. Have more questions about crossing the pond with your pooch?

If you have a transfer time of more than 3 hours, or your flight is operated with a Boeing 787-9 or 787-10 aircraft, then you are not allowed to travel with a pet in the hold. To bring your cat or dog with you, you’ll pay a fee of EUR 75 to EUR 400 per one-way.\n\n## Pets in Cargo\n\nPets that exceed the maximum weight for traveling in the hold, those traveling alone, or animals that are heading to countries where they require pets to be transported as freight, can all go through Air France-KLM Cargo instead, where animals are shipped with a special cargo agent. Pets and carriers weighing more than 165 lbs (75 kg) or exceeding 115\" (292 cm) in height must travel this way. On some types of aircraft, the kennel must not be larger than 97\" (247 cm). You can contact them directly at 800-556-9000 to find out prices, availability, and conditions for your pet's travel plans.\n\n## Carrier Guidelines\n\nFor animals traveling in the cabin, carriers must be soft-sided and no bigger than 18\" x 11\" x 9\" (46 cm x 28 cm x 24 cm). Pets must be able to stand up and lay down comfortably inside. For pets traveling in the hold, carriers must not exceed the dimensions of 48\" x 32\" x 35\" (122 cm x 81 cm x 89 cm) on KLM flights and 40\" x 27\" x 30\" (102 cm x 69 cm x 76 cm) on KLM Cityhopper flights. Carriers must alsohave a fiberglass or rigid plastic shell, wheels must be removed or blocked with duct tape, the door must have a centralized locking system, and the two parts of the carrier must be joined by bolts. It must be large enough for your pet to stand up without touching the top, turn around easily, and lie down in a natural position.\n\n## Other Restrictions\n\nUnfortunately, snub-nosed breeds are not allowed to travel with KLM. Animals of this type must be transported via KLM Cargo. The following dog breeds are not accepted for travel with KLM: Affenpinscher, American Bully, Boston Terrier, Boxers (all breeds), Bulldogs (all breeds), Bull Mastiff, Cane Corso, Pugs (all breeds), Chow-Chow, Great Dane (all breeds), Certain breeds of Spaniel (Tibetan, Japanese, English, King Charles), Brussels Griffon, Lhasa Apso, Mastiffs (all breeds), Neapolitan Mastiff, Pekingese, Small Brabant, Shih Tzu, Shar Pei, Staffordshire Bull Terrier.

When I arrived to Mexico I was surprised to see that the kennel of my dog was replaced by a bigger one, to make her feel more comfortable.

    "markdown": "# Ten Tips for Flying with Fido\n\n\n\n\nTaking his first flight can be a somewhat traumatic experience for a dog that’s used to sticking his head out the car window and enjoying the sights along the way. After all, his view just won’t be the same from underneath the seat in front of you, or even worse, from the cargo hold. But getting there can still be half the fun if you follow the ten tips below and make sure you’re familiar with the [Airline Pet Policy](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/), restrictions on [Pet Travel in the US](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/us_regulations/), and any additional [International Pet Travel](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/international/) restrictions at your destination.\n\n\n## 1\\. Book early\n\nMost airlines only allow one or two dogs on each flight, so it’s important to book your dog’s ticket as soon as possible. Don’t buy your ticket until you call the airline and make sure there is a “seat” available for your dog on the flight. Once the agent has confirmed availability, reserve both your seats on the same ticket while you’re still on the phone with the agent.\n\n\n## 2\\. Fly direct\n\nBook a non-stop, direct flight whenever possible and try to fly on a weekday when airports are typically less hectic. If your pet will be traveling in the cargo hold, it’s best to fly in the morning or evening during the summer, and midday during the winter to avoid extremely hot or cold temperatures.\n\n\n## 3\\. Visit the veterinarian\n\nMake an appointment with your pet’s veterinarian for a check-up and make sure all vaccinations are up to date. Obtain a health certificate from your veterinarian dated within 10 days of departure. For travel outside the continental United States, additional planning and health care requirements may be necessary. Visit our International Pet Travel or contact the foreign office of the country you are traveling to for more information.\n\n\n## 4\\. Buy a carrier\n\nWhether your dog is a Chihuahua or a Great Dane, there’s a pet carrier to match. Carriers are available in both hard-sided and soft-sided. Soft-sided carriers are more suitable for carry-on and tend to fit better under the seat, but they’re only permitted in the cabin only. To make sure the carrier will fit under the seat on your flight check the size restrictions of the airline in our Airline Pet Policies section. If your dog will be traveling in the cargo hold, purchase a hard plastic carrier with holes for ventilation instead. Carriers must be big enough for your dog to stand, turn around, and lie down comfortably. If the carrier does not permit him to do this, the airline will refuse transport.\n\n\n## 5\\. Can I see some ID, ma’am?\n\nAfter you’ve purchased an appropriate carrier, write your dog’s name on it and include identification tags with your home address and phone number as well as the address and phone number of someone who can be reached at your destination. Carry a current photograph of your pet as well. If he’s lost during the trip, a photograph will make it much easier for airline employees or the local authorities to search effectively. You might also want to consider a permanent form of id (such as a microchip or tattoo) that will increase the likelihood of reuniting with your dog if he gets lost on the trip.\n\n\n## 6\\. Take a test drive\n\nAnimals travel under less stress when they are accustomed to their carrier before they travel. In the weeks prior to your trip, put your dog in his carrier as often as possible for trips around town.\n\n\n## 7\\. Eat, drink, poop, then play\n\nSince a full stomach might be uncomfortable for your dog during travel, we recommend feeding him about four hours before the flight, if possible. While it’s best to refrain from feeding your dog right before the flight, you can (and should) continue to give him water right up to the time of travel. Just be sure to empty the dish before checking in so it doesn’t spill during the flight. If you’re checking the dog, leave the dishes in the carrier so an airline employee can provide your pet with food and water in the event of an extended delay before or after your flight. You should also exercise your pet and let him use the facilities (i.e. grass) before heading to the airport.\n\n\n## 8\\. Arrive early\n\nArrive at the airport early, but not too early, and have your dog’s health certificate handy. You will not be allowed to check your pet in more than four hours before the flight. Most airlines recommend arriving two hours before your flight when traveling with a pet. Passengers with pets must check-in at the counter; curbside and self service check-in are not allowed.\n\n\n## 9\\. -Don’t- take a Valium\n\nWe don’t mind if you take a Valium before the flight, but don’t give your pet tranquilizers just because you’re nervous. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, in most cases, dogs should not be given sedatives or tranquilizers prior to flying because they can create respiratory and cardiovascular problems as the dog is exposed to increased altitude pressures. They can also alter the animal’s natural ability to balance and maintain equilibrium, which can be dangerous when the carrier is moved. While sedation is generally not advised, the decision on whether or not to prescribe a tranquilizer for your pet should be made by your veterinarian. If he or she decides that tranquilizers are medically necessary for the trip, indicate the name of the drug taken and the dosage on the dog’s carrier.\n\n\n## 10\\. You’ve arrived!\n\nWhen you arrive at your destination, go for a long walk before you check in at the hotel. Your dog will feel more comfortable as soon as he sees (and smells) his new surroundings, and realizes that the same rules and boundaries apply here too. By the time you check into the hotel, your dog will already feel right and home and be ready for whatever adventures are in store for him that week.\n\n\n* * *\n\n## Packing List\n\nDon’t forget these items when packing your dog’s suitcase:\n\n\n- Health certificate and medical records\n- Contact information for your regular veterinarian and an emergency contact at your destination\n- Comb, brush, and flea control products\n- Any special medication your dog might need\n- Spare collar with id tag\n- Pet wipes or grooming products\n- Paper towels and stain remover\n- Enough dog food and treats for the entire trip\n- Plenty of bottled water (a sudden change can upset your dog’s stomach)\n- Food and water dishes\n- Leash and poop bags\n- Your dog’s favorite toy and blanket\n- A list of [dog friendly restaurants](https://www.bringfido.com/restaurant/) and [attractions](https://www.bringfido.com/attraction/) at your destination\n\n\nYour Privacy\n\n\nWe use cookies to deliver our services, personalize content, and get feedback on how people use BringFido so that we can improve.\nBy clicking OK, you accept this as outlined in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.bringfido.com/privacy/#cookies).\n\n\nOK\n\n[iframe](https://www.bringfido.com/google/onetap/)",

Additionally, dogs must appear healthy upon arrival, have a microchip detectable by a universal scanner that was implanted prior to the rabies vaccine, and be at least 6 months old at the time of entry to the U.S. Their microchip number must be included on all required forms and supporting documents. The required forms can be obtained at this [link](https://www.cdc.gov/importation/dogs/us-vaccinated-high-risk-countries.html). For further guidance on returning to the U.S. with your pet from a high-risk country, contact the CDC directly at cdcanimalimports@cdc.gov\n- Dogs are not generally allowed to be imported to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia except for hunting, guarding and guides for the disabled. Dangerous and aggressive dogs, such as Rottweilers, Pit Bulls, Boxers, Mastiffs, Tosas, Bulldogs and Perro de Presa Canarios, are not permitted entry into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia under any circumstances.\n- Animals must be microchipped and accompanied by a KSA import permit from the Saudi Ministry of Agriculture, an endorsed health certificate, and a certificate of origin that must be obtained prior to travel.\n- The USDA APHIS-endorsed veterinary health certificate must state that your pet was examined, vaccinated for all possible diseases, and is healthy overall. The health certificate and certificate of origin must accompany your dog during travel.\n- Travelers with pets may incur a fee for document processing.\n\n## Quarantine Information\n\n\nPets traveling to Saudi Arabia do not need to be quarantined if they meet all the necessary requirements listed above.\n\n\n\n## Download Entry Application\n\nTo download the application form required for entry into Saudi Arabia with a domestic pet, please click the .pdf icon below.\n\n\n[Application](https://media.bringfido.com/travel/country_regulations/SaudiArabia_HealthCert24.pdf)\n\n## Questions & Answers\n\nBe the first to ask a question about this country.\n\n\n[![Bubble](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bubble.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nAsk a Question](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/international/saudi_arabia/?currency=INR)\n\n* * *\n\n[Suggest an Edit](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/international/82/suggestion/)\n\nYour Privacy\n\n\nWe use cookies to deliver our services, personalize content, and get feedback on how people use BringFido so that we can improve.\nBy clicking OK, you accept this as outlined in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.bringfido.com/privacy/#cookies).\n\n\nOK\n\n[iframe](https://www.bringfido.com/google/onetap/)",

My husband and I flew with our two little red poodles on June 4th and 26th nonstop (each way) a 4-hour flight at night. The flights were packed and our dogs were in their required travel bags. This was their first flight vacation and they really did a great job. Taking the dogs through security and check-in was very easy. At the baggage check area and the gate everyone was cordial and we had no trouble. Having never done this and reading different reviews I was concerned that there may be certain issues and I was nervous. Planning well in advance made a big difference. Prior to the flight I had a health certificate issued and all their worming and vaccinations, of course, were up to date. The health certificate was never an issue when we were on the flight or while we were checking in. Something I would do differently though in the future, definitely make sure that if you're traveling from one part of the country to the other or for sure if you fly internationally, only let your dogs drink bottled water and no local water whatsoever. Our dogs drank local water and were sick for 2 weeks. This has nothing to do with the airline of course but it's just a little bit of advice I would pass along. I would also say if you have any antibiotics on hand, you may consider bringing them along. If not, plan on visiting an animal hospital or a vet on your trip. As far as the Frontier airlines is concerned, we were very impressed, the whole process was easy and we found the whole staff to be polite and professional both on board and off. I would recommend getting the larger legroom seats. If you're flying with a pet, you're not allowed to sit in an emergency exit row. All passengers can check in with the Frontier app or login and choose their seats in advance if they like for slightly more and get comfortable seating. I highly recommend this especially when you have a pet carrier at your feet for the whole flight and if your flight is as long as ours were.\n\n- [![Gozde](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/IoGyDsJ79M/asid10160961163814428height50width50ext1626181875hashAeQqHmdfN98n5tNcr1I?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nGozde\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/719365)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nTina at DFW\n\n\n\nI have had the worst experience with this airline. Previously I have flown with my small puppy five times with other airlines. However when I first approach the desk I was asked if I am going around picking up dogs from different countries by the lady named Tina who claims to be the floor manager. I don’t understand what kind of manager can ask that kind of a question. It’s just poor customer service. I’ve never faced such hostility before. She was not even the agricultural health inspection person to be asking me this sort of question. When I asked for another manager she refused. She also continued to refer to my Turkish passport when she was making claims about my dog as if it matters if I am American or Turkish. I simply think this customer service is the worst. I was faced with racism, bigotry and hostility. I was also faced with questions that carry the conversation to a different level. She pacifically said “I mean really are you just going around picking up dogs from different countries“. I’ve had all of my health certificates for my dog and she claimed that these were insufficient (have use the same documents every time I fly with my dogs). My documents includes US Department transportation air transportation animal form, it also includes rabies certificates, it includes animal health certificates and it includes that she was checked just the day before the flight to make sure that she was OK to go. I also have a list of every single treatment that my dog has received for the past six months. She even claimed that I printed them off and I signed them myself instead of the certified vet. I highly suggest flying with American Airlines instead of this airline — just spend a couple more bucks and have a pleasant experience. If there is any suggestions on how to give feedback on an employee of Frontier Airlines I would highly appreciate it. I do not think I will ever buy Frontier Airlines again nor would I ever recommend it to anyone I know...\n\n- [![Kat](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nKat\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/118791)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nChanged the rules after I bought ticket\n\n\n\nThey changed the rules about ESA's after I bought my ticket and expected me to look at the website to know about the change in rules.\n\n- [![Cinta](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nCinta\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/38759)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nGreat for bringing guinea pigs!\n\n\n\nFrontier was the only airline we found that would allow us to bring our guinea pig in the cabin (not sure why others do not allow them but they do not seem to).

In the airport, I waited with her near the Pet Relief Area. While she walked through the airport, I put her inside the carrier during the flight in the Airbus as well as in the rental car shuttle. The fit of the soft-sided carrier under the seat (mostly) left something to be desired, so on my next flight with her, I have purchased the premium stretch seat. I don't know whether or not the steward would have offered to place (safely) the carrier elsewhere in the cabin, though one inquired on the return whether it would fit under the seat. Of course, it did do so going.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\njim\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nDirector\n\n\n\nI plan to pick up a puppy in Seattle and bring him back to Denver.

    "markdown": "# Ten Tips for Flying with Fido\n\n\n\n\nTaking his first flight can be a somewhat traumatic experience for a dog that’s used to sticking his head out the car window and enjoying the sights along the way. After all, his view just won’t be the same from underneath the seat in front of you, or even worse, from the cargo hold. But getting there can still be half the fun if you follow the ten tips below and make sure you’re familiar with the [Airline Pet Policy](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/), restrictions on [Pet Travel in the US](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/us_regulations/), and any additional [International Pet Travel](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/international/) restrictions at your destination.\n\n\n## 1\\. Book early\n\nMost airlines only allow one or two dogs on each flight, so it’s important to book your dog’s ticket as soon as possible. Don’t buy your ticket until you call the airline and make sure there is a “seat” available for your dog on the flight. Once the agent has confirmed availability, reserve both your seats on the same ticket while you’re still on the phone with the agent.\n\n\n## 2\\. Fly direct\n\nBook a non-stop, direct flight whenever possible and try to fly on a weekday when airports are typically less hectic. If your pet will be traveling in the cargo hold, it’s best to fly in the morning or evening during the summer, and midday during the winter to avoid extremely hot or cold temperatures.\n\n\n## 3\\. Visit the veterinarian\n\nMake an appointment with your pet’s veterinarian for a check-up and make sure all vaccinations are up to date. Obtain a health certificate from your veterinarian dated within 10 days of departure. For travel outside the continental United States, additional planning and health care requirements may be necessary. Visit our International Pet Travel or contact the foreign office of the country you are traveling to for more information.\n\n\n## 4\\. Buy a carrier\n\nWhether your dog is a Chihuahua or a Great Dane, there’s a pet carrier to match. Carriers are available in both hard-sided and soft-sided. Soft-sided carriers are more suitable for carry-on and tend to fit better under the seat, but they’re only permitted in the cabin only. To make sure the carrier will fit under the seat on your flight check the size restrictions of the airline in our Airline Pet Policies section. If your dog will be traveling in the cargo hold, purchase a hard plastic carrier with holes for ventilation instead. Carriers must be big enough for your dog to stand, turn around, and lie down comfortably. If the carrier does not permit him to do this, the airline will refuse transport.\n\n\n## 5\\. Can I see some ID, ma’am?\n\nAfter you’ve purchased an appropriate carrier, write your dog’s name on it and include identification tags with your home address and phone number as well as the address and phone number of someone who can be reached at your destination. Carry a current photograph of your pet as well. If he’s lost during the trip, a photograph will make it much easier for airline employees or the local authorities to search effectively. You might also want to consider a permanent form of id (such as a microchip or tattoo) that will increase the likelihood of reuniting with your dog if he gets lost on the trip.\n\n\n## 6\\. Take a test drive\n\nAnimals travel under less stress when they are accustomed to their carrier before they travel. In the weeks prior to your trip, put your dog in his carrier as often as possible for trips around town.\n\n\n## 7\\. Eat, drink, poop, then play\n\nSince a full stomach might be uncomfortable for your dog during travel, we recommend feeding him about four hours before the flight, if possible. While it’s best to refrain from feeding your dog right before the flight, you can (and should) continue to give him water right up to the time of travel. Just be sure to empty the dish before checking in so it doesn’t spill during the flight. If you’re checking the dog, leave the dishes in the carrier so an airline employee can provide your pet with food and water in the event of an extended delay before or after your flight. You should also exercise your pet and let him use the facilities (i.e. grass) before heading to the airport.\n\n\n## 8\\. Arrive early\n\nArrive at the airport early, but not too early, and have your dog’s health certificate handy. You will not be allowed to check your pet in more than four hours before the flight. Most airlines recommend arriving two hours before your flight when traveling with a pet. Passengers with pets must check-in at the counter; curbside and self service check-in are not allowed.\n\n\n## 9\\. -Don’t- take a Valium\n\nWe don’t mind if you take a Valium before the flight, but don’t give your pet tranquilizers just because you’re nervous. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, in most cases, dogs should not be given sedatives or tranquilizers prior to flying because they can create respiratory and cardiovascular problems as the dog is exposed to increased altitude pressures. They can also alter the animal’s natural ability to balance and maintain equilibrium, which can be dangerous when the carrier is moved. While sedation is generally not advised, the decision on whether or not to prescribe a tranquilizer for your pet should be made by your veterinarian. If he or she decides that tranquilizers are medically necessary for the trip, indicate the name of the drug taken and the dosage on the dog’s carrier.\n\n\n## 10\\. You’ve arrived!\n\nWhen you arrive at your destination, go for a long walk before you check in at the hotel. Your dog will feel more comfortable as soon as he sees (and smells) his new surroundings, and realizes that the same rules and boundaries apply here too. By the time you check into the hotel, your dog will already feel right and home and be ready for whatever adventures are in store for him that week.\n\n\n* * *\n\n## Packing List\n\nDon’t forget these items when packing your dog’s suitcase:\n\n\n- Health certificate and medical records\n- Contact information for your regular veterinarian and an emergency contact at your destination\n- Comb, brush, and flea control products\n- Any special medication your dog might need\n- Spare collar with id tag\n- Pet wipes or grooming products\n- Paper towels and stain remover\n- Enough dog food and treats for the entire trip\n- Plenty of bottled water (a sudden change can upset your dog’s stomach)\n- Food and water dishes\n- Leash and poop bags\n- Your dog’s favorite toy and blanket\n- A list of [dog friendly restaurants](https://www.bringfido.com/restaurant/) and [attractions](https://www.bringfido.com/attraction/) at your destination\n\n\nYour Privacy\n\n\nWe use cookies to deliver our services, personalize content, and get feedback on how people use BringFido so that we can improve.\nBy clicking OK, you accept this as outlined in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.bringfido.com/privacy/#cookies).\n\n\nOK\n\n[iframe](https://www.bringfido.com/google/onetap/)",

Pets are welcome to fly in the cabin and as checked baggage with Alaska Airlines.\n\n\n[Visit Website](https://www.alaskaair.com/content/travel-info/policies/pets-traveling-with-pets)\n\n\nOr call [(800) 252-7522](tel:+18002527522) for more information.\n\n\nYou can use BringFido to find a [pet friendly place to stay](https://www.bringfido.com/lodging/) at your destination.\n\n\n## Pet Reservations\n\nReserve your pet’s travel early by contacting Alaska Airlines' reservations team at (800) 225-2752 as soon as your travel plans are finalized. There are a limited number of pets allowed in the cabin. Reservations are accepted on a first-come first-served basis and must be placed prior to your travel date.\n\n## Pets in the Cabin\n\nAlaska Airlines allows small pets (dogs, cats, rabbits, and household birds) to travel in the cabin if the combined weight of the pet and carrier does not exceed 20 lbs (9 kg). Pets must be at least 8 weeks old. Each passenger can travel with a maximum of 2 pets, as long as 2 seats are purchased. Up to 2 pets of the same breed may travel in the same carrier. Alaska Airlines can accommodate 1 pet in first class and 5 in the main cabin. Pets must stay completely inside the carrier at all times in the boarding area, Alaska Lounge, and while onboard the aircraft. Passengers must be 18 years old to travel with a pet in the cabin. The fee for pets traveling in the cabin is $100 each way. For flights departing from Canada, the fee is $105 each way.\n\n## Pets in Checked Baggage\n\nAlaska Airlines allows small domestic animals like cats, dogs, ferrets, guinea pigs, hamsters, household birds, non-poisonous reptiles, pot bellied pigs, rabbits, and tropical fish to travel as checked baggage if the combined weight of the pet and carrier does not exceed 150 lbs (68 kg). Other pets may be accepted with approval. Dogs and cats must be at least 8 weeks old to travel as checked baggage. Only 1 adult pet is allowed in each carrier, or 2 live puppies or kittens that weight less than 20 lbs each (9 kg). The fee for pets traveling as checked baggage is $100 each way. Due to the extreme temperatures that may be experienced in the cargo area, Alaska Air may decline pets if they deem the weather too unsafe.\n\n## Pets in Cargo\n\nPets who exceed the weight limits to travel in the cabin or as checked baggage or require transportation alone may be accepted as cargo through Pet Connect air cargo. For more information, contact the Cargo Call Center at (800) 225-2752.\n\n## Carrier Guidelines\n\nFor pets traveling in the cabin, hard-sided carriers must not exceed 17\" x 11\" x 7.5\" (43 cm x 28 cm x 19 cm) and soft-sided carriers must not exceed 17\" x 11\" x 9.5\" (43 cm x 28 cm x 48 cm). Carriers must be leak-proof, have adequate ventilation, and be lined with absorbent bedding. For pets traveling in the hold, carriers must not exceed the dimensions 30\" x 27\" x 40\" (76 cm x 68 cm x 101 cm). Carriers must be solid, have handles, adequate air ventilation, and a sturdy roof. Pets must be provided with food and water bowls attached to the interior.\n\n## Other Restrictions\n\nBrachycephalic (short-nosed) dogs and cats are not accepted for travel as checked baggage with Alaska Airlines, including Boston Terrier, Boxer (all breeds), Bulldog (all breeds), Bull Terrier, Brussels Griffon, Chow Chow, English Toy Spaniel, Japanese Spaniel/Japanese Chin, Mastiff (all breeds), Pekingese, Pit Bull (all breeds), Pug (all breeds), Shih Tzu, and Staffordshire Terrier; cat breeds include Burmese, Exotic Shorthair, Himalayan, and Persian.\n\n## Reviews\n\nBringFido Guest Rating\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/half.svg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlaska Airlines has received a rating of 4.3 out of 5 bones by 12 canine critics on BringFido.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nVisitors generally express satisfaction with Alaska Airlines' pet transport services, praising the airline's reasonable fees, efficient handling, and attentive customer service.

We investigated and found AA and Delta would transport him but in cargo which could not be scheduled till 14 days before the flight. In addition cargo charges were based on weight and distance well over 500 dollars. Alaska adds your dog the same time you make your reservations and you pay 150 when you check the dog in no matter the distance so long as kennel and dog weight less than a 100 pounds. Once the dog is boarded they give you a card indicating the dog is on board. One of our flights the plane was changed and not all planes have room. Alaska helped us reschedule route to Puerto Vallarta. I have found their customer service excellent. We have made 4 trips with our dog in baggage with out incident. So glad we found Alaska we were AA customers but not any more.\n\n- [![Chapin](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nChapin\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/807050)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nSmooth travel\n\n\n\nFlew alone with 3 dogs as checked baggage across the country.

She was locked in the kennel for 12 hours (layover in Seattle) and I was charged almost double what it would have cost to fly down, pick her up and fly home. The worst part was I never knew the cost until she arrived in Anchorage. Terrible customer service and I live here, use Alaska Airlines credit card and club 49 member. The cargo department said the high cost was due to all the extra handling steps required. Apparently they take more steps then if I was on the flight with her\n\n- [![Kimberly](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nKimberly\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/849910)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nAwful company who couldn’t care less about your dogs\n\n\n\nI have two lovely experiences with this awful company. The first happened in May 2021. Super thankful they were allowing people to fly with their dogs. However, once I get to my location, I find out that they put your dogs out by the baggage claim with no one watching them. My fiancé thankfully came into the airport that day to surprise me and saw our dog in a place where anyone could steal him. He literally got him out of the cage and no one stopped him from “stealing” our dog. It took me 30 minutes to get to them… I thought to myself, maybe it’s because it is a smaller airport. So return flight home, going to a big name airport and surprise, surprise, they do it again. This time I had no one to see him first, so literally anyone could have taken him. The only reason security came to us was because someone was using a lighter to take off the zip ties. They never checked to see if we were the owners.\n\n\n\nNow, the most recent thing. Online they do mention something about restricting some flights around the holidays. So I call and ask about this and the customer service person said it was good for me to book tickets and my dogs could come with me. So I book them and then try to talk with someone else to hold my dogs’ spots. 45 minutes later she said she couldn’t do it. I had already wasted 2 hours to be told something I asked about in the beginning. I then ask to speak to someone higher up, and the lady was rude and not empathetic at all about the situation and blamed it on the company not sending out the policy yet. I got a refund from them thankfully but when I said I didn’t want to ever fly with them again, she chuckled and said okay then. So bad overall job taking care of dogs in cargo and bad customer service. Run away from this company!!!!\n\n- [![Zoie](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nZoie\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/785837)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nI am happy\n\n\n\nI filed oversea twice from States with Alaska with my husky. Can't be more happy. It's a bit sad that airline having a more strict policy towards flying pets in cabin. Since mine is medium size, he goes under. But Alaska did an amazing job. The check-in was easy, the staff was kind and they gave you the tag while they on-board your dog so you knew your ferry buddy is there with you on the same airplane.\n\n- [![Poppy](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nPoppy\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/764301)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nFantastic service\n\n\n\nWe were relocating to Austin and decided our 71 pound lab will be in the hold, on the same plane as us. I also checked private pet transport and found it to be too risky. I have flown Alaska many times and found their service to be superior. Not to mention on time flights. I called customer service to check their dog policies and which planes my lab could be booked on. They were very patient and helpful and I finally got us all booked on the flight. We flew first class so we could deplane quickly and pick up our lab. I hadn't slept properly for 2 months after reading horror stories on the internet about dogs in the hold of planes. But Alaska more than delivered on their promise. My lab was treated carefully and I was thrilled to see so many dog lovers among their staff. The fantastic customer service began with the agents who checked us in at San Jose, to the stewardess on the plane who listened patiently and offered to tell the captain that there was a passenger with her lab in the hold. I saw my lab being driven in a white air conditioned van to be loaded on the plane. I received confirmation she was on the plane and she was off the plane within 5 minutes of landing. I don't know why people complain about the $100 fee for dogs on a plane, cargo or not. The alternative is private transport which is 10X or more expensive, or leaving your dog behind. If you want your dog to be well taken care of, bóok with Alaska. Your experience might not be as great as mine as a lot depends on your dog's temperament and personality, but the airline will do a great job. Thanks, Alaska, for taking such good care of my dog. Eternally grateful.\n\n- [![Park](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nPark\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/345709)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nThank you Alaska Airlines!\n\n\n\nFirstly, I don’t know what “Angry in Hawaii” is talking about as she doesn’t really describe the problem. Further “Hawaii is as safe as it gets” is even more confused: Alaska Airlines has and continues to accept pets for flights both to and from Hawai’i. In fact, ALASKA is the ONLY AIRLINE ACCEPTING SMALL PETS IN CARRIERS TO THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS (with restrictions and for a reasonable fee). I have found Alaska Airlines personnel to be uniformly wonderful and hope foolish, ignorant, cheap, combative or other humans with undesirable traits don’t ruin this for those of us who respect the airline’s policies and are very appreciative of the service.\n\n- [![Nancy](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nNancy\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/12290)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\n$100 per ride is cheap\n\n\n\nI’m happy to pay $100 to have my elderly dog in the seat next to me. As for allergies, if you have them, don’t touch my dog. He’s in his own space, paid for, and not running around touching you. And for those of you asking about “cleanup,” if it happens it’s the owners responsibility to clean up after their pets, not the flight attendant’s. Do you think they change your baby’s dirty diapers? I don’t think so.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nFido\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nAlaska--the only way to go\n\n\n\nCan't believe folks whining about having to pay $100 to transport their pet. That's dirt cheap, When took my dog from St. Louis to Seattle and back again, the crew couldn't have been nicer. Both my dog and I were treated with in a welcoming and respectful manner, and it made our trip all the more enjoyable.\n\n\n\nI have never had a bad experience on Alaska Airlines. Just never. From check-in to deplaning, the service has always been top notch. I can't say that about any other airline, and I've flown them all. Like a lot of folks, I take whatever flight is cheapest, but I am always extremely happy when Alaska pops up as the lowest fare, and that's been happening some frequency lately.\n\n\n\nAs for the issue of folks flying with dogs, so long as pet owners are reasonable (and I understand that can be a big if), it shouldn't be a problem. A German shepherd doesn't belong in the cabin, but no one should be upset by a pug or small poodle, so long as the dog is well behaved. If you have a dog that yaps or can't control its bowels, then you should leave it home. If folks have allergies, then they can be separated from the dog. I've never seen more than one animal on a plane, and I fly a fair amount. I'm quite certain that if someone near me had an issue with allergies, flight attendants, at least on Alaska, would have put as much distance between me and the allergic passenger as possible. Frankly, I think the issue of dogs on planes exacerbating allergies is somewhat of a red herring. I have yet to read an account of a passenger who was allergic to dogs having an issue due to a dog being on a plane, and I've read a fair amount.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nKimberly\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nThanks Alaska Airlines!\n\n\n\nWe flew our pup up to Alaska to be with us for two weeks and to be flower girl in our wedding.

They treat your dog very well and keep it in its kennel for as short as time as possible. They do not put your pet in cargo they use baggage, its only $100 dollars to Hawaii for you pet versus the $816 we paid to Hawaiian Airlines. The max time my dog was in a kennel was 7 hrs.

    "markdown": "# Ten Tips for Flying with Fido\n\n\n\n\nTaking his first flight can be a somewhat traumatic experience for a dog that’s used to sticking his head out the car window and enjoying the sights along the way. After all, his view just won’t be the same from underneath the seat in front of you, or even worse, from the cargo hold. But getting there can still be half the fun if you follow the ten tips below and make sure you’re familiar with the [Airline Pet Policy](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/), restrictions on [Pet Travel in the US](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/us_regulations/), and any additional [International Pet Travel](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/international/) restrictions at your destination.\n\n\n## 1\\. Book early\n\nMost airlines only allow one or two dogs on each flight, so it’s important to book your dog’s ticket as soon as possible. Don’t buy your ticket until you call the airline and make sure there is a “seat” available for your dog on the flight. Once the agent has confirmed availability, reserve both your seats on the same ticket while you’re still on the phone with the agent.\n\n\n## 2\\. Fly direct\n\nBook a non-stop, direct flight whenever possible and try to fly on a weekday when airports are typically less hectic. If your pet will be traveling in the cargo hold, it’s best to fly in the morning or evening during the summer, and midday during the winter to avoid extremely hot or cold temperatures.\n\n\n## 3\\. Visit the veterinarian\n\nMake an appointment with your pet’s veterinarian for a check-up and make sure all vaccinations are up to date. Obtain a health certificate from your veterinarian dated within 10 days of departure. For travel outside the continental United States, additional planning and health care requirements may be necessary. Visit our International Pet Travel or contact the foreign office of the country you are traveling to for more information.\n\n\n## 4\\. Buy a carrier\n\nWhether your dog is a Chihuahua or a Great Dane, there’s a pet carrier to match. Carriers are available in both hard-sided and soft-sided. Soft-sided carriers are more suitable for carry-on and tend to fit better under the seat, but they’re only permitted in the cabin only. To make sure the carrier will fit under the seat on your flight check the size restrictions of the airline in our Airline Pet Policies section. If your dog will be traveling in the cargo hold, purchase a hard plastic carrier with holes for ventilation instead. Carriers must be big enough for your dog to stand, turn around, and lie down comfortably. If the carrier does not permit him to do this, the airline will refuse transport.\n\n\n## 5\\. Can I see some ID, ma’am?\n\nAfter you’ve purchased an appropriate carrier, write your dog’s name on it and include identification tags with your home address and phone number as well as the address and phone number of someone who can be reached at your destination. Carry a current photograph of your pet as well. If he’s lost during the trip, a photograph will make it much easier for airline employees or the local authorities to search effectively. You might also want to consider a permanent form of id (such as a microchip or tattoo) that will increase the likelihood of reuniting with your dog if he gets lost on the trip.\n\n\n## 6\\. Take a test drive\n\nAnimals travel under less stress when they are accustomed to their carrier before they travel. In the weeks prior to your trip, put your dog in his carrier as often as possible for trips around town.\n\n\n## 7\\. Eat, drink, poop, then play\n\nSince a full stomach might be uncomfortable for your dog during travel, we recommend feeding him about four hours before the flight, if possible. While it’s best to refrain from feeding your dog right before the flight, you can (and should) continue to give him water right up to the time of travel. Just be sure to empty the dish before checking in so it doesn’t spill during the flight. If you’re checking the dog, leave the dishes in the carrier so an airline employee can provide your pet with food and water in the event of an extended delay before or after your flight. You should also exercise your pet and let him use the facilities (i.e. grass) before heading to the airport.\n\n\n## 8\\. Arrive early\n\nArrive at the airport early, but not too early, and have your dog’s health certificate handy. You will not be allowed to check your pet in more than four hours before the flight. Most airlines recommend arriving two hours before your flight when traveling with a pet. Passengers with pets must check-in at the counter; curbside and self service check-in are not allowed.\n\n\n## 9\\. -Don’t- take a Valium\n\nWe don’t mind if you take a Valium before the flight, but don’t give your pet tranquilizers just because you’re nervous. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, in most cases, dogs should not be given sedatives or tranquilizers prior to flying because they can create respiratory and cardiovascular problems as the dog is exposed to increased altitude pressures. They can also alter the animal’s natural ability to balance and maintain equilibrium, which can be dangerous when the carrier is moved. While sedation is generally not advised, the decision on whether or not to prescribe a tranquilizer for your pet should be made by your veterinarian. If he or she decides that tranquilizers are medically necessary for the trip, indicate the name of the drug taken and the dosage on the dog’s carrier.\n\n\n## 10\\. You’ve arrived!\n\nWhen you arrive at your destination, go for a long walk before you check in at the hotel. Your dog will feel more comfortable as soon as he sees (and smells) his new surroundings, and realizes that the same rules and boundaries apply here too. By the time you check into the hotel, your dog will already feel right and home and be ready for whatever adventures are in store for him that week.\n\n\n* * *\n\n## Packing List\n\nDon’t forget these items when packing your dog’s suitcase:\n\n\n- Health certificate and medical records\n- Contact information for your regular veterinarian and an emergency contact at your destination\n- Comb, brush, and flea control products\n- Any special medication your dog might need\n- Spare collar with id tag\n- Pet wipes or grooming products\n- Paper towels and stain remover\n- Enough dog food and treats for the entire trip\n- Plenty of bottled water (a sudden change can upset your dog’s stomach)\n- Food and water dishes\n- Leash and poop bags\n- Your dog’s favorite toy and blanket\n- A list of [dog friendly restaurants](https://www.bringfido.com/restaurant/) and [attractions](https://www.bringfido.com/attraction/) at your destination\n\n\nYour Privacy\n\n\nWe use cookies to deliver our services, personalize content, and get feedback on how people use BringFido so that we can improve.\nBy clicking OK, you accept this as outlined in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.bringfido.com/privacy/#cookies).\n\n\nOK\n\n[iframe](https://www.bringfido.com/google/onetap/)",

Pets are welcome to travel in the cabin and as checked baggage with Hawaiian Airlines.\n\n\n[Visit Website](https://www.hawaiianairlines.com/our-services/special-assistance/traveling-with-animals)\n\n\nOr call [(800) 367-5320](tel:+18003675320) for more information.\n\n\nYou can use BringFido to find a [pet friendly place to stay](https://www.bringfido.com/lodging/) at your destination.\n\n\n## Pets in the Cabin\n\nHawaiian Airlines welcomes small dogs and cats to fly in the passenger cabin on inter-island flights and flights between the State of Hawaii and the US Mainland, as long as the combined weight of the pet and carrier does not exceed 25 lbs (11 kg). Each passenger can travel with 1 carrier. Only 1 animal is permitted in each carrier, except for 2 puppies or kittens from the same litter or breed. There is a $35 fee for pets traveling in the passenger cabin on inter-island flights. For all other flights, the fee is $125 (each way). Pets are not accepted on international flights or flights to/from JFK, Boston or Austin.\n\n## Pets in Checked Baggage\n\nHawaiian Airlines welcomes dogs, cats, and household birds to be transported as checked baggage on inter-island flights and flights between the State of Hawaii and the US Mainland if the combined weight of the pet and carrier does not exceed 70 lbs (32 kg). The fee is $60 (each way) for inter-island flights and $225 (each way) for all other flights. Only 1 animal is permitted in each carrier, except for 2 puppies or kittens from the same litter or breed. In cases of extreme temperatures, Hawaiian Airlines reserves the right to restrict the transportation of your pet in cargo. Animals are not accepted as checked baggage from April 15 through October 15 from San Jose, CA; Sacramento, CA; Las Vegas, NV; and Phoenix, AZ.\n\n## Pets in Cargo\n\nIf the weight of your pet exceeds the weight limit permitted in the hold or Fido is traveling alone, you can transport them with Hawaiian Airlines Cargo Department. Contact them directly at 1-877-422-2746 for more information.\n\n## Carrier Guidelines\n\nFor pets traveling in the passenger cabin, carriers must be soft-sided, leak proof, and large enough to allow the animal to sit, stand upright, turn, and lay down in a natural position.

However, we had an absolutely AWFUL experience today. Apparently, Hawaiian Airlines had updated their policy to require that dogs flying in-cabin must be able to stand in an upright manner (their heads held at neutral, above-body height) while in their carrier. With a carrier height restriction of a measly 9.5\", this is impossible for most dogs. When we called to reserve a spot for our dogs, we were only told the usual (i.e. carrier and weight limitations, and that dogs must be able to comfortably turn around and lie in their carrier). When we tried to check in with an agent at the guest services counter, she immediately glared at us and told us that she won't allow our dog on the plane. She was completely unsympathetic, unfriendly, and unhelpful. Her only solution was to leave and come back with a hard-sided carrier to throw her in cargo. After debating for some time, we just left and ran into another agent who was able to assist us and was extremely apologetic. Furthermore, the first agent almost denied entry for our tiny 8 pound dog! I completely understand that dogs should not be stuffed into a carrier without any space to move, but their new policy is way too strict. Just be warned that you may be denied entry if you encounter the wrong guest agent!\n\n- [![Summer](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/ZrBJhx36l8/SummerDien.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nSummer\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1582956)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nHawaiian Airlines new pet carrier policy doesn’t make sense\n\n\n\nI flew from Maui OGG to Kauai LIH with my cat and she was taller than 9.5” (which is the max height for the soft sided pet carrier) and they were giving me a hard time because she couldn’t stand in her carrier. But not many cats can with that height restriction. I even had my friend bring a hard carrier for the cargo section but it was still too small.

At the Services desk, where one needs to check in with a pet, I was immediately denied because the agent said my 12 pound dog could not comfortably stand in his soft-sided kennel. Mind you, this is a regulation-size soft sided kennel in which he travels to and from Boston on two 6-hr legs usually via Seattle on excellent Alaska Airlines. We make the round trip twice annually and use the very kennel in which he arrived to HNL on a Hawaiian flight 51 hours ago. Speaking of his fellow Kona-based HA agents he said “they were wrong” to allow me to depart Kona, that there were new rules implemented on June 1 and, other than presenting a printed sheet of paper showing Hawaiian’s new policy, was unwilling to assist me. Distressed and nearly furious, I awaited another agent who at least had the good sense to contact a supervisor. About 30 minutes later (!) a supervisor named Wendy approached, apologized for her delay, explained the policy and allowed me to check in. The new policy apparently does not allow a pet whose head would extend above the carrier when unzipped to travel in the cabin. So you might be able to travel with a 5 pound Chihuahua or heavier low-slung dog. If this BringFido site still shows the image of a small, bright-eyed white canine with its head extending through its soft-sided kennel then BEWARE of travel on Hawaiian with any pet similar in size. My little guy is smaller than that and we almost got stranded at HNL, trying only to return home on a 49 minute flight.\n\n- [![Susan](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/895002/asid481959382342968height50width50ext1557607594hashAeTPlxNUUaPpGfZn?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nSusan\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/177529)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nHassled every time in Oahu\n\n\n\nI have traveled many times with my Dogue De Bordeaux as a service dog and know all the rules and paperwork required....Hawaiian Airlines in Kona and Hilo and Seattle are wonderful...every time I have to go through Oahu even on inter’-island they are rude and try to tell me why my dog cannot go on the airplane....inter-island Oahu asked for my paperwork...the only thing they are allowed to ask me is does my dog provide a service and what that is...This time I got right in her face and all of a sudden my dog was allowed through without them needing anything...interesting. Once I came through Seattle to Oahu and on to Kona and here they go again at H.A. Oahu counter. This supervisor had me in tears trying to refuse me because my letter was on the doctor’s prescription pad instead of letterhead...wow, really? Seattle didn’t mind, no one else ever had a problem with it ever....This woman was horrible...another woman at the counter came up to me and said if I just wouldn’t have shown the letter, they would have allowed me through...Really??

I flew 3 different carriers with my pet and Hawaiian, the 4th carrier gave me the MOST problems. I checked in 3 hours before my flight from San Diego to Honolulu and they made me wait 2 hours while they went to process authorization. They then said they would make an exception and let me fly. I should have made them not make the exception as the Federal complaint was excused because the airline did allow me to fly. Big deal, they just got away with discrimination and will continue to do this over and over again. I guess they truly don't want to accept pets and if so, them they should just NOT do it.\n\n\n\nAlso, it is NOT Hawaii Quarrantine that doesn't allow the pets in the cabin as many are told.

I tried to explain to them that the Hawaii State Department of Agriculture told me directly that is not true. Although, you must go through a tremendous amount of red tape, the requirement to place the dogs in cargo coming into Hawaii is Hawaiian Airlines rule, not the state's. Alaska Airlines does allow small dogs to fly in the cabin with you coming into Hawaii.

I purchased a Noa pass which allows me 60 segments for the same price at anytime. I rarely know exactly when I fly and purchased the pass so I didn't have to deal w chance fees or hikes in last minute prices. I usually book my ticket 3 or 4 hrs prior to leaving.\n\nFlying w my dog is not a problem leaving honolulu. I usually call in to notify them I will be flying w her the moment I get my ticket. At the counter in honolulu, they follow procedure and do the checklist for my letter. I also make a copy for them so they don't have to go in the back to make a copy. They approve the letter, because I got it written exactly how they want it (that process is a whole other story) and they send me on my way.\n\nHowever, on Maui, they have consistently given me issues. They take my letter in the back and review it for over 20 mins leaving me w no one to talk to. They then say they need to review it w their supervisors and send the letter to someone up top. Honolulu does not to this, their staff are trained to process the letter. They are rude on maui. They tell me I need to not only call but also send in a copy of the letter 48 hrs in advance. This is not possible for people who travel frequently between islands and often book their flight only a fews hrs in advance. Further, sometimes I do not have access to a scanner or fax machine for the couple days I'm on maui. Everytime I'm on maui, the rude staff mention this woman Kristen Foster who apparently makes all these ridiculous rules and makes it a headache for people who travel w pets. I'm not sure why she is involved so much on maui, yet I never hear her name on oahu. I've heard other reviews where she has made life very difficult for people to fly w pets. Honest people, who are trying to follow the rules (which constantly chance) should not be treated this way. It is obvious that hawaiian airlines is trying to discourage people from flying w pets. Further, this ridiculous policy that they have come up w is not mandated by the federal government. I have flown on island air and they happily let my emmotional support dog on the plane w out any documentation and they also didn't even try to charge me. There is no one to talk to at hawaiian airlines about this issue. You are at the mercy of the staff at the check in desk. Even when u get your ducks in a row and follow their procedures, they come up w something else. This complaint is only directed at the staff at maui airport and this woman Kristen foster. Honolulu staff have been nothing but professional and kind. I hope hawaiian airlines looks into the rude behavior and irrational policies coming from the maui staff and Kristen foster.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nCelia\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nNot accomodating Pet\n\n\n\nI was to travel Alaska originally which had electrical problems.

This is why i am writing another review if it keeps anyone else from going what we went through its worth it. My dogs flight from Seattle to Hilo was 16 hours. When i got to Oahu i ended up with a 5 hour wait to go to Hilo I tried to bump my dog to a earlier flight and was told i could. Was told to get a big cart and bring him from agriculture to the counter, after looking for a half hour for the cart only to be told i was that i could not use them, went back to tIcket counter only to have a new employee there who told me i could not bump him up and wanted to know who told me that. I explained that the previous employee told me, she wanted to know the persons name ( i did not know) she then told she me she could not help me but called a supervisor and tha'ts when things went very downhill. I wanted her to try and reach cargo as they were closed on the weekend ( which it was ) she would not and told me my dog was not flying from Oahu to Hilo in baggage because no dogs do. At that time i told her i was booked to Hilo through cargo and she wanted proof, cargo does not give you inter Island paperwork till you arrive at cargo so i had nothing to show her for the second half of the flight to Hilo. I think at this point she thought I was lying as she became rude, and nasty. she told me if i thought my dog was flying cargo than i should go there. I asked her where cargo was and she said at cargo i then again asked her where cargo was and she again nastily said at cargo, i then where is cargo located and she raised her voice and said at cargo. As i was walking away a employee whispered to me its on Elliott st. I then spent then next hour trying find a place to stay for the weekend in Oahu ( since the supervisor told me my dog was not flying and it was the weekend and when you call cargo it said it was closed ) could not find any opening to stay that would take a dog. I then called my husband in Hilo in tears telling him that i was more than likely going to rent a van and spend the weekend in a parking lot with our dog till i could talk to someone at cargo on monday. I then called a taxi and the driver was incredible he could tell i was very distressed and i told him what was happening and he told me dogs fly out of cargo all the time to Hilo and that cargo was open for dogs going out. He also told me that if for some reason they were not open he would help me so i did not have to sleep in a rented van. He also took my dog to a dog park so he could get out of his kennel for a short time. He took me to cargo and they were expecting and waiting for my dog and yes my dog was flying in baggage to Hilo just like I told the supervisor at Hawaiian. I paid $816.00 for my dog to fly from Seattle to Hilo and were abused for that money. Saddest of all was that the Hawaiian supervisor could have reached cargo and it would have been cleared up instead she chose not to help me and on top of it treat me very rudely. I complained to Hawaiian airline and they came back and said it was a misunderstanding and gave me 1000 miles. No apology for the treatment i received from her. we no longer fly Hawaiian. We own property on the big island and now use Alaska Airlines and its only $100 dollars each direction for your pet to fly, it goes in baggage not cargo. They allow you to put you dog on right before the flight, no 3 hours early in cargo ( which is just plain cruel. A vet meets us in Kona and inspects our dogs paperwork and then we drive to Hilo. I do not think Hawaiian should be allowed to fly pets especially when they are unwilling to help you if there is a problem. More than anything i am glad our dog survived, he was so traumatized it was horrifying. i do not want anyone to go through what we went through.It was one of the most traumatizing thing I have been through. I take responsibilty for using Hawaiian cargo and learned a hard lesson from it never again. We even canceled our Hawaiian credit card.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nLila\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nVery Pleased\n\n\n\nOn our move to Hawai with our dogs, Hawaiian was very Helpful.

    "markdown": "# International Pet Travel\n\nMany countries have strict regulations regarding international pet travel. You’ll find an overview of bringing Fido to many popular international destinations below. No matter where you’re going, you should contact the embassy or consulate of the destination country to confirm pet travel regulations, obtain all of the necessary paperwork (such as health certificates and documentation) regarding your pet’s travel, and contact your local veterinarian to ensure your pet is in compliance with foreign health regulations.\n\n\n\nFinally, don’t forget to check regulations on bringing Fido back to your home country too. Quarantine rules may apply even if your dog has only been gone a short time. Have more questions about crossing the pond with your pooch?

However, we had an absolutely AWFUL experience today. Apparently, Hawaiian Airlines had updated their policy to require that dogs flying in-cabin must be able to stand in an upright manner (their heads held at neutral, above-body height) while in their carrier. With a carrier height restriction of a measly 9.5\", this is impossible for most dogs. When we called to reserve a spot for our dogs, we were only told the usual (i.e. carrier and weight limitations, and that dogs must be able to comfortably turn around and lie in their carrier). When we tried to check in with an agent at the guest services counter, she immediately glared at us and told us that she won't allow our dog on the plane. She was completely unsympathetic, unfriendly, and unhelpful. Her only solution was to leave and come back with a hard-sided carrier to throw her in cargo. After debating for some time, we just left and ran into another agent who was able to assist us and was extremely apologetic. Furthermore, the first agent almost denied entry for our tiny 8 pound dog! I completely understand that dogs should not be stuffed into a carrier without any space to move, but their new policy is way too strict. Just be warned that you may be denied entry if you encounter the wrong guest agent!\n\n- [![Summer](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/ZrBJhx36l8/SummerDien.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nSummer\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1582956)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nHawaiian Airlines new pet carrier policy doesn’t make sense\n\n\n\nI flew from Maui OGG to Kauai LIH with my cat and she was taller than 9.5” (which is the max height for the soft sided pet carrier) and they were giving me a hard time because she couldn’t stand in her carrier. But not many cats can with that height restriction. I even had my friend bring a hard carrier for the cargo section but it was still too small. Their policy is obviously do not take into consideration the size of pets. Hawaiian Airlines was not very helpful And just shrugged and told me that rules are rules. But they let me go with the exception that when I fly back to Maui that I would get a new carrier for her.\n\n- [![Betty](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nBetty\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1468081)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nNew requirements are impossible\n\n\n\nThe max size carrier of 16\" x 10\" x 9.5\" are impossible, because I cannot find a carrier that isn't at least 17\"! Before this was never a problem, but now with the new requirements I almost got turned away when taking my cat to the vet the other day. The gate agent at Kona was very curt, brought out a tape measure, told me I couldn't bring her in the cabin! I eventually was let onto the plane, but not until after a lot of back-and-forth. If there is a carrier that anyone knows of that fits their requirement for size, PLEASE share!\n\n- [![M](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/CcC2bS29J3/M.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nM\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1444550)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nQuarantine employees in Oahu\n\n\n\nReminded me of DMV employees.

Luckily my wife is skilled at working with entitled people as a hotel front desk agent. She was able to stroke the lady’s egos just enough to get our dogs processed in time. We almost missed our connecting flight to Maui from California because the quarantine employees seemed to have some office drama going on between them.

At the Services desk, where one needs to check in with a pet, I was immediately denied because the agent said my 12 pound dog could not comfortably stand in his soft-sided kennel. Mind you, this is a regulation-size soft sided kennel in which he travels to and from Boston on two 6-hr legs usually via Seattle on excellent Alaska Airlines. We make the round trip twice annually and use the very kennel in which he arrived to HNL on a Hawaiian flight 51 hours ago. Speaking of his fellow Kona-based HA agents he said “they were wrong” to allow me to depart Kona, that there were new rules implemented on June 1 and, other than presenting a printed sheet of paper showing Hawaiian’s new policy, was unwilling to assist me. Distressed and nearly furious, I awaited another agent who at least had the good sense to contact a supervisor. About 30 minutes later (!) a supervisor named Wendy approached, apologized for her delay, explained the policy and allowed me to check in. The new policy apparently does not allow a pet whose head would extend above the carrier when unzipped to travel in the cabin. So you might be able to travel with a 5 pound Chihuahua or heavier low-slung dog. If this BringFido site still shows the image of a small, bright-eyed white canine with its head extending through its soft-sided kennel then BEWARE of travel on Hawaiian with any pet similar in size. My little guy is smaller than that and we almost got stranded at HNL, trying only to return home on a 49 minute flight.\n\n- [![Susan](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/895002/asid481959382342968height50width50ext1557607594hashAeTPlxNUUaPpGfZn?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nSusan\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/177529)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nHassled every time in Oahu\n\n\n\nI have traveled many times with my Dogue De Bordeaux as a service dog and know all the rules and paperwork required....Hawaiian Airlines in Kona and Hilo and Seattle are wonderful...every time I have to go through Oahu even on inter’-island they are rude and try to tell me why my dog cannot go on the airplane....inter-island Oahu asked for my paperwork...the only thing they are allowed to ask me is does my dog provide a service and what that is...This time I got right in her face and all of a sudden my dog was allowed through without them needing anything...interesting. Once I came through Seattle to Oahu and on to Kona and here they go again at H.A. Oahu counter. This supervisor had me in tears trying to refuse me because my letter was on the doctor’s prescription pad instead of letterhead...wow, really? Seattle didn’t mind, no one else ever had a problem with it ever....This woman was horrible...another woman at the counter came up to me and said if I just wouldn’t have shown the letter, they would have allowed me through...Really?? Incredible...\n\nI love flying Hawaiian Airlines and will continue to do so now that I know their game in Oahu\n\n- [![Derek](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nDerek\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/105509)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nGreat expirence\n\n\n\nWhile vacationing on Kauai last February we adopted \"Shamu\" our 4 year old black lab... Little did we know when adopting him that nobody would fly him back to Massachusetts for us.... except Hawaiian. We flew Shamu home via cargo and he was just fine!\n\n\n\nThe Humane Society was incredibly helpful in ensuring that we had all the correct paperwork for Shamu - but made one small mistake on his medical sheet. It wasn't a huge problem they quickly drew us up a new one and we ran over to get it (Only a few miles away).\n\n\n\nIf you make sure you get to your flight early and you have the proper paperwork easy peasy!\n\n\n\nI attached a nice little letter introducing himself to the airline staff and a little bag of candy for them as well. They treated our boy with much aloha and he had a great flight home.\n\n\n\nThe only caution I will give is if you are flying your dog into a cold climate... BEWARE! You MUST watch the weather reports like a hawk or your dog may not fly.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nHikari\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nNot Pet Friendly\n\n\n\nFiled a federal complaint against Hawaiian. I flew 3 different carriers with my pet and Hawaiian, the 4th carrier gave me the MOST problems. I checked in 3 hours before my flight from San Diego to Honolulu and they made me wait 2 hours while they went to process authorization. They then said they would make an exception and let me fly. I should have made them not make the exception as the Federal complaint was excused because the airline did allow me to fly. Big deal, they just got away with discrimination and will continue to do this over and over again. I guess they truly don't want to accept pets and if so, them they should just NOT do it.\n\n\n\nAlso, it is NOT Hawaii Quarrantine that doesn't allow the pets in the cabin as many are told. It is the AIRLINES who are refusing to allow the pets in cabin into Hawaii. Kudos to ALASKA AIR. They have no become my go to airline!!\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nAnna\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nNo wagging tails\n\n\n\ndesk lady asked how old my pet was and before I could say the month she insiseded on calling the supervisor saying my dog wasn't old enough. After explaining my pet was over 8 weeks old and missing my flight I find out that no where does it say pets need to be 8 weeks old. The ONLY reference to a pets age is when considering to put two in one container when flying\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nJoni\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nUnresponsive!\n\n\n\nWe have actually decided to not fly Hawaiian anymore into Hawaii because they will not allow,our dogs in the cabin with us. I have tried very hard to speak with their public relations/customer service people at corporate to try to change this, but they absolutely will not respond. The people you get on the phone when you call their 800 number simply say it is \"Hawaii State Law\". I tried to explain to them that the Hawaii State Department of Agriculture told me directly that is not true. Although, you must go through a tremendous amount of red tape, the requirement to place the dogs in cargo coming into Hawaii is Hawaiian Airlines rule, not the state's. Alaska Airlines does allow small dogs to fly in the cabin with you coming into Hawaii. I hate to change Airlines, but my babies are too important to put through that kind of trauma.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nCheryl West\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nTerrified\n\n\n\nAfter the tremendous amount of paperwork Hawaii requires to bring your dog you would certainly expect Hawaiian Aire to accommodate travelers with their beloved pets.

I purchased a Noa pass which allows me 60 segments for the same price at anytime. I rarely know exactly when I fly and purchased the pass so I didn't have to deal w chance fees or hikes in last minute prices. I usually book my ticket 3 or 4 hrs prior to leaving.\n\nFlying w my dog is not a problem leaving honolulu. I usually call in to notify them I will be flying w her the moment I get my ticket. At the counter in honolulu, they follow procedure and do the checklist for my letter. I also make a copy for them so they don't have to go in the back to make a copy. They approve the letter, because I got it written exactly how they want it (that process is a whole other story) and they send me on my way.\n\nHowever, on Maui, they have consistently given me issues. They take my letter in the back and review it for over 20 mins leaving me w no one to talk to. They then say they need to review it w their supervisors and send the letter to someone up top. Honolulu does not to this, their staff are trained to process the letter. They are rude on maui. They tell me I need to not only call but also send in a copy of the letter 48 hrs in advance. This is not possible for people who travel frequently between islands and often book their flight only a fews hrs in advance. Further, sometimes I do not have access to a scanner or fax machine for the couple days I'm on maui. Everytime I'm on maui, the rude staff mention this woman Kristen Foster who apparently makes all these ridiculous rules and makes it a headache for people who travel w pets. I'm not sure why she is involved so much on maui, yet I never hear her name on oahu. I've heard other reviews where she has made life very difficult for people to fly w pets. Honest people, who are trying to follow the rules (which constantly chance) should not be treated this way. It is obvious that hawaiian airlines is trying to discourage people from flying w pets. Further, this ridiculous policy that they have come up w is not mandated by the federal government. I have flown on island air and they happily let my emmotional support dog on the plane w out any documentation and they also didn't even try to charge me. There is no one to talk to at hawaiian airlines about this issue. You are at the mercy of the staff at the check in desk. Even when u get your ducks in a row and follow their procedures, they come up w something else. This complaint is only directed at the staff at maui airport and this woman Kristen foster. Honolulu staff have been nothing but professional and kind. I hope hawaiian airlines looks into the rude behavior and irrational policies coming from the maui staff and Kristen foster.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nCelia\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nNot accomodating Pet\n\n\n\nI was to travel Alaska originally which had electrical problems. They purchased a ticket on Hawwaiian to accommodate me with my 4 lb chuahua. I was attempting to make my schedule with quarantine on a direct release from Las Vegas to Kahului HI. After I ran clear to the other end of the terminal the representatives would not let me on w/o a certificate from my Dr. stating I had special needs/assistance. in order for Zorro to ride in the cabin with me. I'm not impressed now that I read there policy and it states he could have flown with a $175 charge. Instead I ran back to Alaska which was great in the end. My poor dog was stuck in his kennel w/o bathroom from 4:45 AM LV time to 11:30 PM LV time when we arrived in Kahalui 8:30 PM. It just wasn't right.\n\nI showed all my paperwork for the 5 day or direct release program which should have sufficed.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nmike richards\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nHappy, happy ,happy\n\n\n\nI found the Hawaiian Airlines employees to be very friendly and helpful , I shipped my 106 lb. bull mastiff thru their cargo dept. from Seattle to Honolulu.

This is why i am writing another review if it keeps anyone else from going what we went through its worth it. My dogs flight from Seattle to Hilo was 16 hours. When i got to Oahu i ended up with a 5 hour wait to go to Hilo I tried to bump my dog to a earlier flight and was told i could. Was told to get a big cart and bring him from agriculture to the counter, after looking for a half hour for the cart only to be told i was that i could not use them, went back to tIcket counter only to have a new employee there who told me i could not bump him up and wanted to know who told me that. I explained that the previous employee told me, she wanted to know the persons name ( i did not know) she then told she me she could not help me but called a supervisor and tha'ts when things went very downhill. I wanted her to try and reach cargo as they were closed on the weekend ( which it was ) she would not and told me my dog was not flying from Oahu to Hilo in baggage because no dogs do. At that time i told her i was booked to Hilo through cargo and she wanted proof, cargo does not give you inter Island paperwork till you arrive at cargo so i had nothing to show her for the second half of the flight to Hilo. I think at this point she thought I was lying as she became rude, and nasty. she told me if i thought my dog was flying cargo than i should go there. I asked her where cargo was and she said at cargo i then again asked her where cargo was and she again nastily said at cargo, i then where is cargo located and she raised her voice and said at cargo. As i was walking away a employee whispered to me its on Elliott st. I then spent then next hour trying find a place to stay for the weekend in Oahu ( since the supervisor told me my dog was not flying and it was the weekend and when you call cargo it said it was closed ) could not find any opening to stay that would take a dog. I then called my husband in Hilo in tears telling him that i was more than likely going to rent a van and spend the weekend in a parking lot with our dog till i could talk to someone at cargo on monday. I then called a taxi and the driver was incredible he could tell i was very distressed and i told him what was happening and he told me dogs fly out of cargo all the time to Hilo and that cargo was open for dogs going out. He also told me that if for some reason they were not open he would help me so i did not have to sleep in a rented van. He also took my dog to a dog park so he could get out of his kennel for a short time. He took me to cargo and they were expecting and waiting for my dog and yes my dog was flying in baggage to Hilo just like I told the supervisor at Hawaiian. I paid $816.00 for my dog to fly from Seattle to Hilo and were abused for that money. Saddest of all was that the Hawaiian supervisor could have reached cargo and it would have been cleared up instead she chose not to help me and on top of it treat me very rudely. I complained to Hawaiian airline and they came back and said it was a misunderstanding and gave me 1000 miles. No apology for the treatment i received from her. we no longer fly Hawaiian. We own property on the big island and now use Alaska Airlines and its only $100 dollars each direction for your pet to fly, it goes in baggage not cargo. They allow you to put you dog on right before the flight, no 3 hours early in cargo ( which is just plain cruel. A vet meets us in Kona and inspects our dogs paperwork and then we drive to Hilo. I do not think Hawaiian should be allowed to fly pets especially when they are unwilling to help you if there is a problem. More than anything i am glad our dog survived, he was so traumatized it was horrifying. i do not want anyone to go through what we went through.It was one of the most traumatizing thing I have been through. I take responsibilty for using Hawaiian cargo and learned a hard lesson from it never again. We even canceled our Hawaiian credit card.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nLila\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nVery Pleased\n\n\n\nOn our move to Hawai with our dogs, Hawaiian was very Helpful. When we boarded we told the flight attendant that we had 2 dogs in cargo. He went to check that they were boarded, then went to check himself. They were under the pilots where the fresh air comes in and they kept the light on for them. When we got them from the animal office -they were ready for release as soon as we landed, got our bags and got to the office. They were very helpful in making our and our dogs flights very comfortable.\n\n\nLoad More Reviews\n\nLoading…\n\nFailed.\n[Post a Review](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/15/review/)![Bubble](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bubble.svg)\n\nPost a Review\n\n\n## Traveler Photos\n\n\nWe haven‘t received any photos of dogs flying Hawaiian Airlines yet.\n\n\n\n\nWant to feature your creature?

Pets are welcome to travel in the cabin and as checked baggage in the hold with KLM.\n\n\n[Visit Website](https://www.klm.com/travel/us_en/prepare_for_travel/travel_planning/pets/index.htm)\n\n\nOr call [(866) 434-0320](tel:+18664340320) for more information.\n\n\nYou can use BringFido to find a [pet friendly place to stay](https://www.bringfido.com/lodging/) at your destination.\n\n\n## Pets in the Cabin\n\nKLM welcomes small cats and dogs into the economy cabin on most of their flights, and in business class on flights within Europe. Dogs are welcome in the cabin if the combined weight of the pet and carrier is under 18 lbs (8 kg). Each passenger is permitted to travel with 1 pet. To bring your cat or dog with you, you’ll pay a fee of EUR 75 to EUR 400 per one-way.\n\n## Pets in Checked Baggage\n\nPets and carriers weighing more than 18 lbs (8 kg) can be transported in the hold with KLM. To travel as checked baggage in the hold, pets and carriers can weigh a maximum 165 lbs (75 kg). Passengers can check up to 3 pets in the hold. If you have a transfer time of more than 3 hours, or your flight is operated with a Boeing 787-9 or 787-10 aircraft, then you are not allowed to travel with a pet in the hold. To bring your cat or dog with you, you’ll pay a fee of EUR 75 to EUR 400 per one-way.\n\n## Pets in Cargo\n\nPets that exceed the maximum weight for traveling in the hold, those traveling alone, or animals that are heading to countries where they require pets to be transported as freight, can all go through Air France-KLM Cargo instead, where animals are shipped with a special cargo agent. Pets and carriers weighing more than 165 lbs (75 kg) or exceeding 115\" (292 cm) in height must travel this way. On some types of aircraft, the kennel must not be larger than 97\" (247 cm). You can contact them directly at 800-556-9000 to find out prices, availability, and conditions for your pet's travel plans.\n\n## Carrier Guidelines\n\nFor animals traveling in the cabin, carriers must be soft-sided and no bigger than 18\" x 11\" x 9\" (46 cm x 28 cm x 24 cm). Pets must be able to stand up and lay down comfortably inside. For pets traveling in the hold, carriers must not exceed the dimensions of 48\" x 32\" x 35\" (122 cm x 81 cm x 89 cm) on KLM flights and 40\" x 27\" x 30\" (102 cm x 69 cm x 76 cm) on KLM Cityhopper flights. Carriers must alsohave a fiberglass or rigid plastic shell, wheels must be removed or blocked with duct tape, the door must have a centralized locking system, and the two parts of the carrier must be joined by bolts. It must be large enough for your pet to stand up without touching the top, turn around easily, and lie down in a natural position.\n\n## Other Restrictions\n\nUnfortunately, snub-nosed breeds are not allowed to travel with KLM. Animals of this type must be transported via KLM Cargo. The following dog breeds are not accepted for travel with KLM: Affenpinscher, American Bully, Boston Terrier, Boxers (all breeds), Bulldogs (all breeds), Bull Mastiff, Cane Corso, Pugs (all breeds), Chow-Chow, Great Dane (all breeds), Certain breeds of Spaniel (Tibetan, Japanese, English, King Charles), Brussels Griffon, Lhasa Apso, Mastiffs (all breeds), Neapolitan Mastiff, Pekingese, Small Brabant, Shih Tzu, Shar Pei, Staffordshire Bull Terrier.

I lucked with a pet loving traveller in my row and an empty seat beside me on my first leg and the flight crew moved me to a similar setting on the second leg of the journey after finding the person in my initial assigned row had allergies.

    "markdown": "# Airline Pet Policies\n\nPlanning to fly with your dog? While air travel can be a quick way to get Fido from one place to another, you should know that every airline has different rules about transporting pets. Some allow small dogs to travel in the aircraft cabin as part of your carry-on luggage allowance, while others will only allow pets to travel in the cargo area, and fees can vary from nothing at all to more than $500. Also, most airlines only allow one or two dogs on each flight, so always make sure a “seat” is available for your dog BEFORE buying your own ticket.\n\n\nTo take off without a hitch, please read our [Ten Tips for Flying with Fido](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/top_10_tips/), and familiarize yourself with current [U.S. Travel Regulations](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/us_regulations/) or [International Pet Travel](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/international/) restrictions before you go.

However, we had an absolutely AWFUL experience today. Apparently, Hawaiian Airlines had updated their policy to require that dogs flying in-cabin must be able to stand in an upright manner (their heads held at neutral, above-body height) while in their carrier. With a carrier height restriction of a measly 9.5\", this is impossible for most dogs. When we called to reserve a spot for our dogs, we were only told the usual (i.e. carrier and weight limitations, and that dogs must be able to comfortably turn around and lie in their carrier). When we tried to check in with an agent at the guest services counter, she immediately glared at us and told us that she won't allow our dog on the plane. She was completely unsympathetic, unfriendly, and unhelpful. Her only solution was to leave and come back with a hard-sided carrier to throw her in cargo. After debating for some time, we just left and ran into another agent who was able to assist us and was extremely apologetic. Furthermore, the first agent almost denied entry for our tiny 8 pound dog! I completely understand that dogs should not be stuffed into a carrier without any space to move, but their new policy is way too strict. Just be warned that you may be denied entry if you encounter the wrong guest agent!\n\n- [![Summer](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/ZrBJhx36l8/SummerDien.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nSummer\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1582956)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nHawaiian Airlines new pet carrier policy doesn’t make sense\n\n\n\nI flew from Maui OGG to Kauai LIH with my cat and she was taller than 9.5” (which is the max height for the soft sided pet carrier) and they were giving me a hard time because she couldn’t stand in her carrier. But not many cats can with that height restriction. I even had my friend bring a hard carrier for the cargo section but it was still too small. Their policy is obviously do not take into consideration the size of pets. Hawaiian Airlines was not very helpful And just shrugged and told me that rules are rules. But they let me go with the exception that when I fly back to Maui that I would get a new carrier for her.\n\n- [![Betty](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nBetty\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1468081)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nNew requirements are impossible\n\n\n\nThe max size carrier of 16\" x 10\" x 9.5\" are impossible, because I cannot find a carrier that isn't at least 17\"! Before this was never a problem, but now with the new requirements I almost got turned away when taking my cat to the vet the other day. The gate agent at Kona was very curt, brought out a tape measure, told me I couldn't bring her in the cabin! I eventually was let onto the plane, but not until after a lot of back-and-forth.

Heartless, cold, hating life and definitely hating their jobs. Can’t even look at you when communicating. If you don’t play along with their mood they will complicate things for you. Luckily my wife is skilled at working with entitled people as a hotel front desk agent. She was able to stroke the lady’s egos just enough to get our dogs processed in time. We almost missed our connecting flight to Maui from California because the quarantine employees seemed to have some office drama going on between them. My advice: if going to an outer island be sure to use the direct release program.\n\n- [![Sid](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/F5oCMBZOdC/SidKarpav.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nSid\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1420249)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nBEWARE of new HA in-cabin policy…\n\n\n\nAm at Honolulu (HNL) awaiting return to Kona (KOA), from where we left two days ago. At the Services desk, where one needs to check in with a pet, I was immediately denied because the agent said my 12 pound dog could not comfortably stand in his soft-sided kennel. Mind you, this is a regulation-size soft sided kennel in which he travels to and from Boston on two 6-hr legs usually via Seattle on excellent Alaska Airlines. We make the round trip twice annually and use the very kennel in which he arrived to HNL on a Hawaiian flight 51 hours ago. Speaking of his fellow Kona-based HA agents he said “they were wrong” to allow me to depart Kona, that there were new rules implemented on June 1 and, other than presenting a printed sheet of paper showing Hawaiian’s new policy, was unwilling to assist me. Distressed and nearly furious, I awaited another agent who at least had the good sense to contact a supervisor. About 30 minutes later (!) a supervisor named Wendy approached, apologized for her delay, explained the policy and allowed me to check in. The new policy apparently does not allow a pet whose head would extend above the carrier when unzipped to travel in the cabin. So you might be able to travel with a 5 pound Chihuahua or heavier low-slung dog. If this BringFido site still shows the image of a small, bright-eyed white canine with its head extending through its soft-sided kennel then BEWARE of travel on Hawaiian with any pet similar in size. My little guy is smaller than that and we almost got stranded at HNL, trying only to return home on a 49 minute flight.\n\n- [![Susan](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/895002/asid481959382342968height50width50ext1557607594hashAeTPlxNUUaPpGfZn?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nSusan\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/177529)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nHassled every time in Oahu\n\n\n\nI have traveled many times with my Dogue De Bordeaux as a service dog and know all the rules and paperwork required....Hawaiian Airlines in Kona and Hilo and Seattle are wonderful...every time I have to go through Oahu even on inter’-island they are rude and try to tell me why my dog cannot go on the airplane....inter-island Oahu asked for my paperwork...the only thing they are allowed to ask me is does my dog provide a service and what that is...This time I got right in her face and all of a sudden my dog was allowed through without them needing anything...interesting. Once I came through Seattle to Oahu and on to Kona and here they go again at H.A. Oahu counter. This supervisor had me in tears trying to refuse me because my letter was on the doctor’s prescription pad instead of letterhead...wow, really? Seattle didn’t mind, no one else ever had a problem with it ever....This woman was horrible...another woman at the counter came up to me and said if I just wouldn’t have shown the letter, they would have allowed me through...Really?? Incredible...\n\nI love flying Hawaiian Airlines and will continue to do so now that I know their game in Oahu\n\n- [![Derek](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nDerek\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/105509)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nGreat expirence\n\n\n\nWhile vacationing on Kauai last February we adopted \"Shamu\" our 4 year old black lab... Little did we know when adopting him that nobody would fly him back to Massachusetts for us.... except Hawaiian. We flew Shamu home via cargo and he was just fine!\n\n\n\nThe Humane Society was incredibly helpful in ensuring that we had all the correct paperwork for Shamu - but made one small mistake on his medical sheet. It wasn't a huge problem they quickly drew us up a new one and we ran over to get it (Only a few miles away).\n\n\n\nIf you make sure you get to your flight early and you have the proper paperwork easy peasy!\n\n\n\nI attached a nice little letter introducing himself to the airline staff and a little bag of candy for them as well. They treated our boy with much aloha and he had a great flight home.\n\n\n\nThe only caution I will give is if you are flying your dog into a cold climate... BEWARE! You MUST watch the weather reports like a hawk or your dog may not fly.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nHikari\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nNot Pet Friendly\n\n\n\nFiled a federal complaint against Hawaiian. I flew 3 different carriers with my pet and Hawaiian, the 4th carrier gave me the MOST problems. I checked in 3 hours before my flight from San Diego to Honolulu and they made me wait 2 hours while they went to process authorization. They then said they would make an exception and let me fly. I should have made them not make the exception as the Federal complaint was excused because the airline did allow me to fly. Big deal, they just got away with discrimination and will continue to do this over and over again. I guess they truly don't want to accept pets and if so, them they should just NOT do it.\n\n\n\nAlso, it is NOT Hawaii Quarrantine that doesn't allow the pets in the cabin as many are told. It is the AIRLINES who are refusing to allow the pets in cabin into Hawaii. Kudos to ALASKA AIR. They have no become my go to airline!!\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nAnna\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nNo wagging tails\n\n\n\ndesk lady asked how old my pet was and before I could say the month she insiseded on calling the supervisor saying my dog wasn't old enough.

I have tried very hard to speak with their public relations/customer service people at corporate to try to change this, but they absolutely will not respond. The people you get on the phone when you call their 800 number simply say it is \"Hawaii State Law\". I tried to explain to them that the Hawaii State Department of Agriculture told me directly that is not true. Although, you must go through a tremendous amount of red tape, the requirement to place the dogs in cargo coming into Hawaii is Hawaiian Airlines rule, not the state's. Alaska Airlines does allow small dogs to fly in the cabin with you coming into Hawaii.

I purchased a Noa pass which allows me 60 segments for the same price at anytime. I rarely know exactly when I fly and purchased the pass so I didn't have to deal w chance fees or hikes in last minute prices. I usually book my ticket 3 or 4 hrs prior to leaving.\n\nFlying w my dog is not a problem leaving honolulu. I usually call in to notify them I will be flying w her the moment I get my ticket. At the counter in honolulu, they follow procedure and do the checklist for my letter. I also make a copy for them so they don't have to go in the back to make a copy. They approve the letter, because I got it written exactly how they want it (that process is a whole other story) and they send me on my way.\n\nHowever, on Maui, they have consistently given me issues. They take my letter in the back and review it for over 20 mins leaving me w no one to talk to. They then say they need to review it w their supervisors and send the letter to someone up top. Honolulu does not to this, their staff are trained to process the letter. They are rude on maui. They tell me I need to not only call but also send in a copy of the letter 48 hrs in advance. This is not possible for people who travel frequently between islands and often book their flight only a fews hrs in advance. Further, sometimes I do not have access to a scanner or fax machine for the couple days I'm on maui. Everytime I'm on maui, the rude staff mention this woman Kristen Foster who apparently makes all these ridiculous rules and makes it a headache for people who travel w pets. I'm not sure why she is involved so much on maui, yet I never hear her name on oahu. I've heard other reviews where she has made life very difficult for people to fly w pets. Honest people, who are trying to follow the rules (which constantly chance) should not be treated this way. It is obvious that hawaiian airlines is trying to discourage people from flying w pets. Further, this ridiculous policy that they have come up w is not mandated by the federal government. I have flown on island air and they happily let my emmotional support dog on the plane w out any documentation and they also didn't even try to charge me. There is no one to talk to at hawaiian airlines about this issue. You are at the mercy of the staff at the check in desk. Even when u get your ducks in a row and follow their procedures, they come up w something else. This complaint is only directed at the staff at maui airport and this woman Kristen foster. Honolulu staff have been nothing but professional and kind. I hope hawaiian airlines looks into the rude behavior and irrational policies coming from the maui staff and Kristen foster.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nCelia\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nNot accomodating Pet\n\n\n\nI was to travel Alaska originally which had electrical problems. They purchased a ticket on Hawwaiian to accommodate me with my 4 lb chuahua. I was attempting to make my schedule with quarantine on a direct release from Las Vegas to Kahului HI. After I ran clear to the other end of the terminal the representatives would not let me on w/o a certificate from my Dr. stating I had special needs/assistance. in order for Zorro to ride in the cabin with me. I'm not impressed now that I read there policy and it states he could have flown with a $175 charge. Instead I ran back to Alaska which was great in the end. My poor dog was stuck in his kennel w/o bathroom from 4:45 AM LV time to 11:30 PM LV time when we arrived in Kahalui 8:30 PM. It just wasn't right.\n\nI showed all my paperwork for the 5 day or direct release program which should have sufficed.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nmike richards\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nHappy, happy ,happy\n\n\n\nI found the Hawaiian Airlines employees to be very friendly and helpful , I shipped my 106 lb. bull mastiff thru their cargo dept. from Seattle to Honolulu.

This is why i am writing another review if it keeps anyone else from going what we went through its worth it. My dogs flight from Seattle to Hilo was 16 hours. When i got to Oahu i ended up with a 5 hour wait to go to Hilo I tried to bump my dog to a earlier flight and was told i could. Was told to get a big cart and bring him from agriculture to the counter, after looking for a half hour for the cart only to be told i was that i could not use them, went back to tIcket counter only to have a new employee there who told me i could not bump him up and wanted to know who told me that. I explained that the previous employee told me, she wanted to know the persons name ( i did not know) she then told she me she could not help me but called a supervisor and tha'ts when things went very downhill. I wanted her to try and reach cargo as they were closed on the weekend ( which it was ) she would not and told me my dog was not flying from Oahu to Hilo in baggage because no dogs do. At that time i told her i was booked to Hilo through cargo and she wanted proof, cargo does not give you inter Island paperwork till you arrive at cargo so i had nothing to show her for the second half of the flight to Hilo. I think at this point she thought I was lying as she became rude, and nasty. she told me if i thought my dog was flying cargo than i should go there. I asked her where cargo was and she said at cargo i then again asked her where cargo was and she again nastily said at cargo, i then where is cargo located and she raised her voice and said at cargo. As i was walking away a employee whispered to me its on Elliott st. I then spent then next hour trying find a place to stay for the weekend in Oahu ( since the supervisor told me my dog was not flying and it was the weekend and when you call cargo it said it was closed ) could not find any opening to stay that would take a dog. I then called my husband in Hilo in tears telling him that i was more than likely going to rent a van and spend the weekend in a parking lot with our dog till i could talk to someone at cargo on monday. I then called a taxi and the driver was incredible he could tell i was very distressed and i told him what was happening and he told me dogs fly out of cargo all the time to Hilo and that cargo was open for dogs going out. He also told me that if for some reason they were not open he would help me so i did not have to sleep in a rented van. He also took my dog to a dog park so he could get out of his kennel for a short time. He took me to cargo and they were expecting and waiting for my dog and yes my dog was flying in baggage to Hilo just like I told the supervisor at Hawaiian. I paid $816.00 for my dog to fly from Seattle to Hilo and were abused for that money. Saddest of all was that the Hawaiian supervisor could have reached cargo and it would have been cleared up instead she chose not to help me and on top of it treat me very rudely. I complained to Hawaiian airline and they came back and said it was a misunderstanding and gave me 1000 miles. No apology for the treatment i received from her. we no longer fly Hawaiian. We own property on the big island and now use Alaska Airlines and its only $100 dollars each direction for your pet to fly, it goes in baggage not cargo. They allow you to put you dog on right before the flight, no 3 hours early in cargo ( which is just plain cruel. A vet meets us in Kona and inspects our dogs paperwork and then we drive to Hilo. I do not think Hawaiian should be allowed to fly pets especially when they are unwilling to help you if there is a problem. More than anything i am glad our dog survived, he was so traumatized it was horrifying. i do not want anyone to go through what we went through.It was one of the most traumatizing thing I have been through. I take responsibilty for using Hawaiian cargo and learned a hard lesson from it never again. We even canceled our Hawaiian credit card.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nLila\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nVery Pleased\n\n\n\nOn our move to Hawai with our dogs, Hawaiian was very Helpful. When we boarded we told the flight attendant that we had 2 dogs in cargo. He went to check that they were boarded, then went to check himself. They were under the pilots where the fresh air comes in and they kept the light on for them. When we got them from the animal office -they were ready for release as soon as we landed, got our bags and got to the office. They were very helpful in making our and our dogs flights very comfortable.\n\n\nLoad More Reviews\n\nLoading…\n\nFailed.\n[Post a Review](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/15/review/)![Bubble](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bubble.svg)\n\nPost a Review\n\n\n## Traveler Photos\n\n\nWe haven‘t received any photos of dogs flying Hawaiian Airlines yet.\n\n\n\n\nWant to feature your creature?

Pets are welcome to travel in the cabin and as checked baggage in the hold with KLM.\n\n\n[Visit Website](https://www.klm.com/travel/us_en/prepare_for_travel/travel_planning/pets/index.htm)\n\n\nOr call [(866) 434-0320](tel:+18664340320) for more information.\n\n\nYou can use BringFido to find a [pet friendly place to stay](https://www.bringfido.com/lodging/) at your destination.\n\n\n## Pets in the Cabin\n\nKLM welcomes small cats and dogs into the economy cabin on most of their flights, and in business class on flights within Europe. Dogs are welcome in the cabin if the combined weight of the pet and carrier is under 18 lbs (8 kg). Each passenger is permitted to travel with 1 pet. To bring your cat or dog with you, you’ll pay a fee of EUR 75 to EUR 400 per one-way.\n\n## Pets in Checked Baggage\n\nPets and carriers weighing more than 18 lbs (8 kg) can be transported in the hold with KLM. To travel as checked baggage in the hold, pets and carriers can weigh a maximum 165 lbs (75 kg). Passengers can check up to 3 pets in the hold. If you have a transfer time of more than 3 hours, or your flight is operated with a Boeing 787-9 or 787-10 aircraft, then you are not allowed to travel with a pet in the hold. To bring your cat or dog with you, you’ll pay a fee of EUR 75 to EUR 400 per one-way.\n\n## Pets in Cargo\n\nPets that exceed the maximum weight for traveling in the hold, those traveling alone, or animals that are heading to countries where they require pets to be transported as freight, can all go through Air France-KLM Cargo instead, where animals are shipped with a special cargo agent. Pets and carriers weighing more than 165 lbs (75 kg) or exceeding 115\" (292 cm) in height must travel this way. On some types of aircraft, the kennel must not be larger than 97\" (247 cm). You can contact them directly at 800-556-9000 to find out prices, availability, and conditions for your pet's travel plans.\n\n## Carrier Guidelines\n\nFor animals traveling in the cabin, carriers must be soft-sided and no bigger than 18\" x 11\" x 9\" (46 cm x 28 cm x 24 cm). Pets must be able to stand up and lay down comfortably inside. For pets traveling in the hold, carriers must not exceed the dimensions of 48\" x 32\" x 35\" (122 cm x 81 cm x 89 cm) on KLM flights and 40\" x 27\" x 30\" (102 cm x 69 cm x 76 cm) on KLM Cityhopper flights. Carriers must alsohave a fiberglass or rigid plastic shell, wheels must be removed or blocked with duct tape, the door must have a centralized locking system, and the two parts of the carrier must be joined by bolts. It must be large enough for your pet to stand up without touching the top, turn around easily, and lie down in a natural position.\n\n## Other Restrictions\n\nUnfortunately, snub-nosed breeds are not allowed to travel with KLM. Animals of this type must be transported via KLM Cargo. The following dog breeds are not accepted for travel with KLM: Affenpinscher, American Bully, Boston Terrier, Boxers (all breeds), Bulldogs (all breeds), Bull Mastiff, Cane Corso, Pugs (all breeds), Chow-Chow, Great Dane (all breeds), Certain breeds of Spaniel (Tibetan, Japanese, English, King Charles), Brussels Griffon, Lhasa Apso, Mastiffs (all breeds), Neapolitan Mastiff, Pekingese, Small Brabant, Shih Tzu, Shar Pei, Staffordshire Bull Terrier.

On both flights the very nice staff reassurede that my dog was indeed on board and that the pressure and the temperature is fine for my dog in the luggage department in the belly of the plane. When I arrived to Mexico I was surprised to see that the kennel of my dog was replaced by a bigger one, to make her feel more comfortable.

You’ll find an overview of bringing Fido to many popular international destinations below.

However, we had an absolutely AWFUL experience today. Apparently, Hawaiian Airlines had updated their policy to require that dogs flying in-cabin must be able to stand in an upright manner (their heads held at neutral, above-body height) while in their carrier. With a carrier height restriction of a measly 9.5\", this is impossible for most dogs. When we called to reserve a spot for our dogs, we were only told the usual (i.e. carrier and weight limitations, and that dogs must be able to comfortably turn around and lie in their carrier). When we tried to check in with an agent at the guest services counter, she immediately glared at us and told us that she won't allow our dog on the plane. She was completely unsympathetic, unfriendly, and unhelpful. Her only solution was to leave and come back with a hard-sided carrier to throw her in cargo. After debating for some time, we just left and ran into another agent who was able to assist us and was extremely apologetic. Furthermore, the first agent almost denied entry for our tiny 8 pound dog! I completely understand that dogs should not be stuffed into a carrier without any space to move, but their new policy is way too strict. Just be warned that you may be denied entry if you encounter the wrong guest agent!\n\n- [![Summer](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/ZrBJhx36l8/SummerDien.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nSummer\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1582956)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nHawaiian Airlines new pet carrier policy doesn’t make sense\n\n\n\nI flew from Maui OGG to Kauai LIH with my cat and she was taller than 9.5” (which is the max height for the soft sided pet carrier) and they were giving me a hard time because she couldn’t stand in her carrier. But not many cats can with that height restriction. I even had my friend bring a hard carrier for the cargo section but it was still too small. Their policy is obviously do not take into consideration the size of pets. Hawaiian Airlines was not very helpful And just shrugged and told me that rules are rules. But they let me go with the exception that when I fly back to Maui that I would get a new carrier for her.\n\n- [![Betty](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nBetty\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1468081)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nNew requirements are impossible\n\n\n\nThe max size carrier of 16\" x 10\" x 9.5\" are impossible, because I cannot find a carrier that isn't at least 17\"! Before this was never a problem, but now with the new requirements I almost got turned away when taking my cat to the vet the other day. The gate agent at Kona was very curt, brought out a tape measure, told me I couldn't bring her in the cabin! I eventually was let onto the plane, but not until after a lot of back-and-forth. If there is a carrier that anyone knows of that fits their requirement for size, PLEASE share!\n\n- [![M](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/CcC2bS29J3/M.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nM\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1444550)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nQuarantine employees in Oahu\n\n\n\nReminded me of DMV employees. Heartless, cold, hating life and definitely hating their jobs. Can’t even look at you when communicating. If you don’t play along with their mood they will complicate things for you. Luckily my wife is skilled at working with entitled people as a hotel front desk agent. She was able to stroke the lady’s egos just enough to get our dogs processed in time. We almost missed our connecting flight to Maui from California because the quarantine employees seemed to have some office drama going on between them. My advice: if going to an outer island be sure to use the direct release program.\n\n- [![Sid](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/F5oCMBZOdC/SidKarpav.jpg?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nSid\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/1420249)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nBEWARE of new HA in-cabin policy…\n\n\n\nAm at Honolulu (HNL) awaiting return to Kona (KOA), from where we left two days ago. At the Services desk, where one needs to check in with a pet, I was immediately denied because the agent said my 12 pound dog could not comfortably stand in his soft-sided kennel. Mind you, this is a regulation-size soft sided kennel in which he travels to and from Boston on two 6-hr legs usually via Seattle on excellent Alaska Airlines. We make the round trip twice annually and use the very kennel in which he arrived to HNL on a Hawaiian flight 51 hours ago. Speaking of his fellow Kona-based HA agents he said “they were wrong” to allow me to depart Kona, that there were new rules implemented on June 1 and, other than presenting a printed sheet of paper showing Hawaiian’s new policy, was unwilling to assist me. Distressed and nearly furious, I awaited another agent who at least had the good sense to contact a supervisor. About 30 minutes later (!) a supervisor named Wendy approached, apologized for her delay, explained the policy and allowed me to check in. The new policy apparently does not allow a pet whose head would extend above the carrier when unzipped to travel in the cabin. So you might be able to travel with a 5 pound Chihuahua or heavier low-slung dog. If this BringFido site still shows the image of a small, bright-eyed white canine with its head extending through its soft-sided kennel then BEWARE of travel on Hawaiian with any pet similar in size. My little guy is smaller than that and we almost got stranded at HNL, trying only to return home on a 49 minute flight.\n\n- [![Susan](https://photos.bringfido.com/user/895002/asid481959382342968height50width50ext1557607594hashAeTPlxNUUaPpGfZn?size=avatar&density=2x)\\\\\n\\\\\nSusan\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/177529)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nHassled every time in Oahu\n\n\n\nI have traveled many times with my Dogue De Bordeaux as a service dog and know all the rules and paperwork required....Hawaiian Airlines in Kona and Hilo and Seattle are wonderful...every time I have to go through Oahu even on inter’-island they are rude and try to tell me why my dog cannot go on the airplane....inter-island Oahu asked for my paperwork...the only thing they are allowed to ask me is does my dog provide a service and what that is...This time I got right in her face and all of a sudden my dog was allowed through without them needing anything...interesting. Once I came through Seattle to Oahu and on to Kona and here they go again at H.A. Oahu counter. This supervisor had me in tears trying to refuse me because my letter was on the doctor’s prescription pad instead of letterhead...wow, really? Seattle didn’t mind, no one else ever had a problem with it ever....This woman was horrible...another woman at the counter came up to me and said if I just wouldn’t have shown the letter, they would have allowed me through...Really?? Incredible...\n\nI love flying Hawaiian Airlines and will continue to do so now that I know their game in Oahu\n\n- [![Derek](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nDerek\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMore than a year ago](https://www.bringfido.com/user/105509)\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nGreat expirence\n\n\n\nWhile vacationing on Kauai last February we adopted \"Shamu\" our 4 year old black lab... Little did we know when adopting him that nobody would fly him back to Massachusetts for us.... except Hawaiian. We flew Shamu home via cargo and he was just fine!\n\n\n\nThe Humane Society was incredibly helpful in ensuring that we had all the correct paperwork for Shamu - but made one small mistake on his medical sheet. It wasn't a huge problem they quickly drew us up a new one and we ran over to get it (Only a few miles away).\n\n\n\nIf you make sure you get to your flight early and you have the proper paperwork easy peasy!\n\n\n\nI attached a nice little letter introducing himself to the airline staff and a little bag of candy for them as well. They treated our boy with much aloha and he had a great flight home.\n\n\n\nThe only caution I will give is if you are flying your dog into a cold climate... BEWARE! You MUST watch the weather reports like a hawk or your dog may not fly.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nHikari\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nNot Pet Friendly\n\n\n\nFiled a federal complaint against Hawaiian. I flew 3 different carriers with my pet and Hawaiian, the 4th carrier gave me the MOST problems. I checked in 3 hours before my flight from San Diego to Honolulu and they made me wait 2 hours while they went to process authorization. They then said they would make an exception and let me fly. I should have made them not make the exception as the Federal complaint was excused because the airline did allow me to fly. Big deal, they just got away with discrimination and will continue to do this over and over again. I guess they truly don't want to accept pets and if so, them they should just NOT do it.\n\n\n\nAlso, it is NOT Hawaii Quarrantine that doesn't allow the pets in the cabin as many are told. It is the AIRLINES who are refusing to allow the pets in cabin into Hawaii. Kudos to ALASKA AIR. They have no become my go to airline!!\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nAnna\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nNo wagging tails\n\n\n\ndesk lady asked how old my pet was and before I could say the month she insiseded on calling the supervisor saying my dog wasn't old enough.

I have tried very hard to speak with their public relations/customer service people at corporate to try to change this, but they absolutely will not respond. The people you get on the phone when you call their 800 number simply say it is \"Hawaii State Law\". I tried to explain to them that the Hawaii State Department of Agriculture told me directly that is not true. Although, you must go through a tremendous amount of red tape, the requirement to place the dogs in cargo coming into Hawaii is Hawaiian Airlines rule, not the state's. Alaska Airlines does allow small dogs to fly in the cabin with you coming into Hawaii. I hate to change Airlines, but my babies are too important to put through that kind of trauma.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nCheryl West\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nTerrified\n\n\n\nAfter the tremendous amount of paperwork Hawaii requires to bring your dog you would certainly expect Hawaiian Aire to accommodate travelers with their beloved pets.

I purchased a Noa pass which allows me 60 segments for the same price at anytime. I rarely know exactly when I fly and purchased the pass so I didn't have to deal w chance fees or hikes in last minute prices. I usually book my ticket 3 or 4 hrs prior to leaving.\n\nFlying w my dog is not a problem leaving honolulu. I usually call in to notify them I will be flying w her the moment I get my ticket. At the counter in honolulu, they follow procedure and do the checklist for my letter. I also make a copy for them so they don't have to go in the back to make a copy. They approve the letter, because I got it written exactly how they want it (that process is a whole other story) and they send me on my way.\n\nHowever, on Maui, they have consistently given me issues. They take my letter in the back and review it for over 20 mins leaving me w no one to talk to. They then say they need to review it w their supervisors and send the letter to someone up top. Honolulu does not to this, their staff are trained to process the letter. They are rude on maui. They tell me I need to not only call but also send in a copy of the letter 48 hrs in advance. This is not possible for people who travel frequently between islands and often book their flight only a fews hrs in advance. Further, sometimes I do not have access to a scanner or fax machine for the couple days I'm on maui. Everytime I'm on maui, the rude staff mention this woman Kristen Foster who apparently makes all these ridiculous rules and makes it a headache for people who travel w pets. I'm not sure why she is involved so much on maui, yet I never hear her name on oahu. I've heard other reviews where she has made life very difficult for people to fly w pets. Honest people, who are trying to follow the rules (which constantly chance) should not be treated this way. It is obvious that hawaiian airlines is trying to discourage people from flying w pets. Further, this ridiculous policy that they have come up w is not mandated by the federal government. I have flown on island air and they happily let my emmotional support dog on the plane w out any documentation and they also didn't even try to charge me. There is no one to talk to at hawaiian airlines about this issue. You are at the mercy of the staff at the check in desk. Even when u get your ducks in a row and follow their procedures, they come up w something else. This complaint is only directed at the staff at maui airport and this woman Kristen foster. Honolulu staff have been nothing but professional and kind. I hope hawaiian airlines looks into the rude behavior and irrational policies coming from the maui staff and Kristen foster.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nCelia\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nNot accomodating Pet\n\n\n\nI was to travel Alaska originally which had electrical problems. They purchased a ticket on Hawwaiian to accommodate me with my 4 lb chuahua. I was attempting to make my schedule with quarantine on a direct release from Las Vegas to Kahului HI. After I ran clear to the other end of the terminal the representatives would not let me on w/o a certificate from my Dr. stating I had special needs/assistance. in order for Zorro to ride in the cabin with me. I'm not impressed now that I read there policy and it states he could have flown with a $175 charge. Instead I ran back to Alaska which was great in the end. My poor dog was stuck in his kennel w/o bathroom from 4:45 AM LV time to 11:30 PM LV time when we arrived in Kahalui 8:30 PM. It just wasn't right.\n\nI showed all my paperwork for the 5 day or direct release program which should have sufficed.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nmike richards\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nHappy, happy ,happy\n\n\n\nI found the Hawaiian Airlines employees to be very friendly and helpful , I shipped my 106 lb. bull mastiff thru their cargo dept. from Seattle to Honolulu. It took only a few minutes to check him in. He arrived happy and healthy. I would recommend them to anyone who wants problem free transport of their dogs\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nMichelle\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/empty.svg)\n\nnot pet friendly\n\n\n\nI flew my 69 lb lab two yrs ago with Hawaiian and still can get over what happened. This is why i am writing another review if it keeps anyone else from going what we went through its worth it. My dogs flight from Seattle to Hilo was 16 hours. When i got to Oahu i ended up with a 5 hour wait to go to Hilo I tried to bump my dog to a earlier flight and was told i could. Was told to get a big cart and bring him from agriculture to the counter, after looking for a half hour for the cart only to be told i was that i could not use them, went back to tIcket counter only to have a new employee there who told me i could not bump him up and wanted to know who told me that. I explained that the previous employee told me, she wanted to know the persons name ( i did not know) she then told she me she could not help me but called a supervisor and tha'ts when things went very downhill. I wanted her to try and reach cargo as they were closed on the weekend ( which it was ) she would not and told me my dog was not flying from Oahu to Hilo in baggage because no dogs do. At that time i told her i was booked to Hilo through cargo and she wanted proof, cargo does not give you inter Island paperwork till you arrive at cargo so i had nothing to show her for the second half of the flight to Hilo. I think at this point she thought I was lying as she became rude, and nasty. she told me if i thought my dog was flying cargo than i should go there. I asked her where cargo was and she said at cargo i then again asked her where cargo was and she again nastily said at cargo, i then where is cargo located and she raised her voice and said at cargo. As i was walking away a employee whispered to me its on Elliott st. I then spent then next hour trying find a place to stay for the weekend in Oahu ( since the supervisor told me my dog was not flying and it was the weekend and when you call cargo it said it was closed ) could not find any opening to stay that would take a dog. I then called my husband in Hilo in tears telling him that i was more than likely going to rent a van and spend the weekend in a parking lot with our dog till i could talk to someone at cargo on monday. I then called a taxi and the driver was incredible he could tell i was very distressed and i told him what was happening and he told me dogs fly out of cargo all the time to Hilo and that cargo was open for dogs going out. He also told me that if for some reason they were not open he would help me so i did not have to sleep in a rented van. He also took my dog to a dog park so he could get out of his kennel for a short time. He took me to cargo and they were expecting and waiting for my dog and yes my dog was flying in baggage to Hilo just like I told the supervisor at Hawaiian. I paid $816.00 for my dog to fly from Seattle to Hilo and were abused for that money. Saddest of all was that the Hawaiian supervisor could have reached cargo and it would have been cleared up instead she chose not to help me and on top of it treat me very rudely. I complained to Hawaiian airline and they came back and said it was a misunderstanding and gave me 1000 miles. No apology for the treatment i received from her. we no longer fly Hawaiian. We own property on the big island and now use Alaska Airlines and its only $100 dollars each direction for your pet to fly, it goes in baggage not cargo. They allow you to put you dog on right before the flight, no 3 hours early in cargo ( which is just plain cruel. A vet meets us in Kona and inspects our dogs paperwork and then we drive to Hilo. I do not think Hawaiian should be allowed to fly pets especially when they are unwilling to help you if there is a problem. More than anything i am glad our dog survived, he was so traumatized it was horrifying. i do not want anyone to go through what we went through.It was one of the most traumatizing thing I have been through. I take responsibilty for using Hawaiian cargo and learned a hard lesson from it never again. We even canceled our Hawaiian credit card.\n\n- ![Default avatar](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/avatars/default.svg)\n\n\nLila\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a year ago\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)![](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bones/full.svg)\n\nVery Pleased\n\n\n\nOn our move to Hawai with our dogs, Hawaiian was very Helpful. When we boarded we told the flight attendant that we had 2 dogs in cargo. He went to check that they were boarded, then went to check himself. They were under the pilots where the fresh air comes in and they kept the light on for them. When we got them from the animal office -they were ready for release as soon as we landed, got our bags and got to the office. They were very helpful in making our and our dogs flights very comfortable.\n\n\nLoad More Reviews\n\nLoading…\n\nFailed.\n[Post a Review](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/15/review/)![Bubble](https://www.bringfido.com/assets/images/icons/brand/bubble.svg)\n\nPost a Review\n\n\n## Traveler Photos\n\n\nWe haven‘t received any photos of dogs flying Hawaiian Airlines yet.\n\n\n\n\nWant to feature your creature?
