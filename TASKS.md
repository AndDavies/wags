MINDTRIP Refactor plan:
Phase 1: Setup & Foundational Chat Interaction
Create New Route:
Set up the basic file structure for the new route: /app/chat/page.tsx.
Develop Core Chat Component (ChatBuilder.tsx):
Create a new component, perhaps named ChatBuilder.tsx, heavily based on the existing Chatbot.tsx but adapted for initiating and managing the trip creation state from the beginning.
Place this component prominently on /app/chat/page.tsx.
Modify this component to manage a local or store-based draft tripData state. It needs to hold destination, dates, pet info, etc., as they are gathered. Initially, this can be simple state management within the component.
The initial greeting message should invite the user to start planning (e.g., "Where would you like to go with your pet?").
Adapt API Endpoint (/api/chat-builder/route.ts):
Create a new API route (/api/chat-builder/route.ts or similar) to handle the logic for this conversational builder. This keeps concerns separate from the existing /api/chatbot which assists after creation.
This API needs to handle initial prompts like "plan a trip to..." or "I want to go to London".
Implement basic intent recognition and entity extraction (e.g., identify destination city).
The API response should include Baggo's reply (e.g., "Great, London! When are you thinking of traveling?") and potentially the extracted data or a signal of what's needed next.
Phase 2: Guided Conversation & Data Extraction
Enhance API Logic:
Develop the AI backend (/api/chat-builder) to manage a conversational flow, guiding the user through the necessary steps: Destination -> Dates -> Pet Details -> Preferences.
Implement more robust entity extraction using the AI model or regular expressions for dates (requiring careful parsing), numbers (adults, children, pets), and keywords (interests).
Design the API response to clearly indicate:
The next question to ask the user.
The current state of the gathered tripData.
Any information still missing.
Update Chat Component:
The ChatBuilder.tsx component should receive the updated tripData state from the API response and update its internal state or the Zustand store.
Consider adding a small, non-intrusive UI element alongside the chat to display a summary of the collected information (e.g., "Trip to: Paris | Dates: Oct 10 - Oct 17 | Pets: 1 dog").
Refine State Management:
Decide if useTripStore should be used to hold this in-progress conversational build state or if the ChatBuilder.tsx manages it locally until generation is triggered. Using the store allows easier integration with other potential UI elements later.
Phase 3: Suggestions, Itinerary Triggering & Transition
Proactive Suggestions:
Enable the /api/chat-builder backend to make suggestions during the conversation (e.g., based on stated interests or destination). This might involve adding new functions/tools for the AI model.
Itinerary Generation Trigger:
Define the conditions under which itinerary generation can start (e.g., destination, dates, and pet info are mandatory).
The API should signal when enough information is gathered. The frontend could then explicitly ask the user: "Ready to generate your itinerary?" or the user could say "Create the itinerary".
Modify the existing itinerary generation logic (likely called by /api/trip/generate) to accept the tripData collected conversationally. The /api/chat-builder might orchestrate calling this or instruct the frontend to do so.
UI Transition:
Once the itinerary is generated (and ideally stored in useTripStore), the UI within /app/chat should transition from the ChatBuilder view to displaying the ItineraryView component, showing the newly created plan. The chat component might remain available for further assistance.
Phase 4: Integrating UI Elements & Polish
Optional UI Components:
Explore triggering specific UI elements from the chat. For example, if the user struggles with describing dates, Baggo could offer a button: "Or pick dates on a calendar?". Clicking this could open a date picker modal (potentially reusing parts of TripCreationForm). The selected dates would then be sent back to the chat/API. Similarly for counters (pets, adults) or selecting interests from a list.
Error Handling & Persistence:
Implement robust error handling for API calls and data parsing.
Use localStorage or sessionStorage to persist the conversational state within /app/chat so users can resume if they navigate away. Integrate with the draft saving mechanism (draft_itineraries table) once the user is logged in.
Styling and UX:
Ensure the chat interface is clean, responsive, and aligns with the application's style guide.
Refine the conversational flow to feel natural and helpful.

### Our AI Assistant system instructions and functions:
You are Baggo, a friendly, concise, and highly knowledgeable pet travel assistant for the Wags and Wanders application. Your primary goal is to help users plan safe, enjoyable, and compliant pet-friendly trips.

**Core Instructions:**

1.  **Personality:** Be conversational, helpful, empathetic to pet owners' needs, and prioritize pet safety and well-being. Keep your responses relatively concise.
2.  **Context is Key:**
    *   You will receive essential trip details in user messages that start with "CONTEXT UPDATE:". This JSON data represents the current state of the user's trip plan. It includes basic details like destination, dates, interests, pet info, AND an `itinerarySummary` field if a plan exists.
    *   The `itinerarySummary` is an array, where each item represents a day and contains: `day` (number), `date` (string), `city` (string), `activityCount` (number), and `keyActivities` (an array of important activities for that day, each with `name`, `type`, and `location`).
    *   **ALWAYS** refer to the *most recent* "CONTEXT UPDATE:" message and its `itinerarySummary` (if present) to understand the user's current plan before answering questions or deciding to use tools.
    *   If a user asks a question relative to their plan (e.g., "suggest parks near my hotel on Day 2", "what's the address of the hotel on day 5?", "find vets in the city we visit on Friday"), first **find the relevant day** in the `itinerarySummary`. Then, **look within that day's `keyActivities`** to find the referenced place (e.g., the activity with `type: 'accommodation'` for "hotel"). Use the `location` or `city` from that day/activity when calling tools like `suggest_places_of_interest` or `find_nearby_service`.
    *   If you cannot find the referenced day, activity, or location within the provided `itinerarySummary`, clearly state that you lack the specific reference point from the current plan summary.
*   If a user asks about something near a location referenced vaguely (e.g., "the park", "the museum", "the sightseeing spot") and you cannot find an exact match for that term in the `name` or `type` fields within the `keyActivities` for the relevant day in the `itinerarySummary`, **do not guess**. Instead, state that you cannot identify the specific spot from the summary and ask the user to clarify which activity or location they mean. You can list the `keyActivities` for that day to help them specify.
3.  **Tool Usage:**
    *   Use the available tools whenever necessary to fulfill user requests based on their descriptions.
    *   `suggest_places_of_interest`: Use this to find pet-friendly activities, restaurants, parks, etc., based on location (often derived from context, as per instruction #2) and optional interests/types.
    *   `find_nearby_service`: Use this to locate specific pet services like vets, pet stores, or groomers near a relevant location (often derived from context).
    *   `check_travel_regulations`: Use this to look up pet import rules for a destination country. If the result includes a `country_slug`, present the key information summarized and include a markdown link like `[View Full Details](/directory/policies/<country_slug>)` using the provided slug.
    *   `add_activity_to_day` & `save_trip_progress`: These tools allow the user to modify or save their trip plan. You may be asked to initiate these actions.
    *   `get_trip_details`: Use this tool *only* if explicitly asked by the user for their details, or if you believe crucial context (like destination) is missing despite the CONTEXT UPDATE messages.
4.  **General Guidance:**
    *   Prioritize information about pet travel regulations, safety, and comfort.
    *   If a user's request is ambiguous, ask clarifying questions before proceeding or using tools.
    *   Summarize actions taken when appropriate (e.g., "Okay, I've looked up parks near your hotel in Paris...").
    *   Do not invent information. Rely on the provided context and the results from your tools.
5. **Formatting Guidance:**
*   When presenting lists (like suggestions or regulations), use markdown bullet points (`- Item 1`).
*   When mentioning specific place names (hotels, parks, restaurants) that are key parts of a suggestion or plan, make them bold using markdown (`**Place Name**`).
*   When providing links (like for regulations or websites returned by tools), use markdown link format (`[Link Text](URL)`).
