      <li><em>Health Certificate:</em> EU Pet Passport (for EU citizens or those coming from listed countries that issue passports like San Marino, Vatican, etc.) or EU Health Certificate issued by an official vet (for pets from outside EU, within 10 days of arrival, in Italian/English). Owner’s declaration of non-commercial purpose required.</li>
      <li><em>Import Permit:</em> Not needed for personal pet travel from EU or listed countries. (Only needed for endangered species under CITES or more than 5 pets without proof of non-commercial intent.)</li>
      <li><em>Rabies Titer:</em> Required if coming from a high-risk, unlisted country – blood test ≥0.5 IU/ml at EU-approved lab, at least 3 months before entry【26†L337-L345】.</li>
      <li><em>Parasite Treatment:</em> Not required prior to entry (Italy not Echinococcus-free). No compulsory tapeworm or tick treatment for regular pets. However, if traveling from an area with known Echinococcus, owners are advised to treat pets to be safe (not enforced at border).</li>
      <li><em>Age Minimum:</em> 15 weeks. Italy does <strong>not allow</strong> entry of unvaccinated pets under 3 months old (no exceptions; rabies vaccination is a must)【25†L37-L41】. (Since 2005, import of under-3-month unvaccinated pets is prohibited by Italian regulation【64†L37-L40】.)</li>
      <li><em>Banned Breeds/Species:</em> No banned dog breeds for import. (Italy does **not** ban pit bulls or others; previous breed-specific regulations were abolished in 2009.) All breeds are allowed if properly documented and non-dangerous. Aggressive individual dogs may be refused entry at the carrier’s discretion. Exotic pets may require permits (CITES). Wolf hybrids require special authorization. Otherwise, no breed restrictions.</li>
    </ul>
  </td>
  <td>No quarantine for pets meeting all requirements. Italy does not quarantine pets if they arrive with correct microchip, documents, and vaccines. Pets without valid rabies vacc or paperwork may be returned to origin or quarantined under official supervision on a case-by-case basis, but routine quarantine is not in practice for compliant pets.</td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>Maximum of 5 pets per traveler (non-commercial limit)【26†L298-L306】; more than 5 requires applying commercial rules or showing proof of participation in events.</li>
      <li>Italy does **not** permit entry of pets under 12 weeks unvaccinated【64†L37-L40】. The Italian Ministry of Health explicitly forbids importing puppies/kittens too young to be vaccinated against rabies.</li>
      <li>Common entry points: Major airports like Rome FCO, Milan MXP have pet clearance facilities. Travelers from outside EU should notify the airport’s customs/veterinary office upon arrival. If driving from non-EU (e.g., Switzerland), stop at border for pet control.</li>
      <li>Within Italy, dogs must be kept on a leash in public and owners must carry a muzzle (obligatory to use in case of risk). These are domestic rules that also apply to visiting pet owners.</li>
      <li>Pet birds (up to 5) require an import veterinary certificate and owner declaration as per EU rules (due to avian flu risk); they must enter via designated Border Inspection Posts. Pet rodents and rabbits need a health certificate but have no quarantine.</li>

      <li><em>Other Vaccinations:</em> Not required by import regulations (only rabies is checked). It is recommended to vaccinate pets against common diseases, but not a legal entry requirement.</li>
      <li><em>Health Certificate:</em> EU Pet Passport (for EU or listed-country pets) or EU health certificate issued by an official vet in country of origin (for pets from outside EU, within 10 days prior, typically in French, German or English).

      <li><em>Import Permit:</em> Not required for pet dogs, cats, ferrets from EU member states or approved third countries following non-commercial rules. (Might be needed if more than 5 pets without proof of competition or if coming from unlisted countries outside EU rules.)</li>
      <li><em>Rabies Titer:</em> Required if entering from a non-listed rabies high-risk country – blood test (≥0.5 IU/ml) by an EU-approved lab, drawn at least 3 months before entry【26†L337-L345】.</li>
      <li><em>Parasite Treatment:</em> Not required on entry (Luxembourg not classified as Echinococcus-free). No mandatory tapeworm or tick treatments.

(If traveling from, say, a tapeworm-free country like Finland to Luxembourg, no treatment needed either.)</li>

      <li><em>Rabies Vaccination:</em> Required for dogs, cats, ferrets ≥12 weeks old. Must be an in-date vaccine given after microchipping; 21 days must pass after first vaccination before entry【26†L329-L336】.</li>
      <li><em>Other Vaccinations:</em> Not required by law for entry (only rabies is mandatory). Given Malta’s climate, it’s recommended pets are protected against ticks and other diseases, but not a formal entry requirement.</li>
      <li><em>Health Certificate:</em> EU Pet Passport (for EU/EEA or other accepted origin) or EU health certificate issued by official vet in origin country (for pets from outside EU, within 10 days prior, in English). Owner’s signed declaration of non-commercial intent also needed.</li>
      <li><em>Import Permit:</em> Generally not required for pets from EU or listed countries following EU pet travel rules. (Import permit system may apply if coming from certain unlisted countries or if any deviation from standard rules.)</li>
      <li><em>Rabies Titer:</em> Required if entering from a high-rabies-risk (unlisted) country – blood test ≥0.5 IU/ml, performed at EU-approved lab, drawn ≥3 months before entry【26†L337-L345】.</li>
      <li><em>Parasite Treatment:</em> **Tapeworm (Echinococcus) treatment is required for dogs** entering Malta. As Malta is free of Echinococcus, dogs must be treated by a vet 24–120 hours before arrival with praziquantel and the treatment recorded【5†L619-L627】. Cats and ferrets: no tapeworm treatment requirement. No mandatory tick treatment, but strongly encouraged due to Mediterranean tick-borne diseases.</li>
      <li><em>Age Minimum:</em> 15 weeks. Malta does <strong>not permit</strong> entry of unvaccinated pets under 3 months【5†L613-L617】. All pets must have rabies vaccination (Malta does not allow the young pet exemption).</li>
      <li><em>Banned Breeds/Species:</em> No banned dog breeds for import (Malta has no breed-specific ban; even historically “dangerous” breeds like pit bulls can enter if properly documented and vaccinated). Exotic species may require permits, and pit bulls / similar may need to be registered and leashed/muzzled in public per local law, but import is not forbidden. No special bans on cat breeds or common pet types.</li>

  </td>
  <td>No quarantine for pets that meet all import rules. Malta relies on the pet passport system instead of quarantine. If an animal arrives without meeting the requirements (e.g., no rabies shot or no tapeworm treatment), it could be denied entry or quarantined in exceptional cases until it meets conditions or is sent back. Routine quarantine is not used for compliant pets.</td>

    <ul>
      <li>Limit of 5 pets per person (in line with EU non-commercial movements)【3†L19-L27】. More than 5 requires a different procedure unless going to a show or competition.</li>
      <li>Malta **requires tapeworm treatment for dogs** before entry【5†L619-L627】. This is a notable additional requirement (shared with Finland, Ireland, etc.) due to Malta’s status as tapeworm-free.</li>
      <li>No underage pet exceptions – Malta does **not** allow under-12-week unvaccinated pets to enter【5†L613-L617】. Rabies-free island policies are strict on vaccination.</li>
      <li>Designated entry: All pets entering Malta by air should arrive via Malta International Airport (MLA), where they must be presented to the Veterinary Regulation Directorate on arrival. Advance notice (at least 24 hours) to Maltese authorities is recommended when bringing pets, especially from outside the EU.</li>
      <li>Local law: Dogs in Malta must be leashed in public and certain breeds (e.g., pit bull types, Rottweilers, etc.) may require a muzzle in public spaces under local council by-laws, but these do not affect the import process, just behavior once in Malta.</li>

      <li><em>Health Certificate:</em> EU Pet Passport (if coming from EU/EEA/CH or other passport-issuing territory) or EU health certificate issued by an official vet (if coming from outside EU, valid 10 days for entry, in Dutch or English typically). Include owner declaration for non-commercial transport.</li>
      <li><em>Import Permit:</em> Not required for pet dogs, cats, ferrets under non-commercial movement rules from EU or listed countries. (Only if bringing in a prohibited species or more than 5 pets without meeting exemption would special permit be needed.)</li>
      <li><em>Rabies Titer:</em> Required if arriving from a country not on EU’s safe list (high rabies risk). Blood test showing antibody ≥0.5 IU/ml, done by EU-approved lab, sampled 30+ days after rabies shot and 3 months before entry【26†L337-L345】.</li>
      <li><em>Parasite Treatment:</em> Not required for entry into NL (Netherlands not free of Echinococcus, so no mandatory pre-treatment). If traveling from a country that requires tapeworm treatment (e.g. leaving the UK), that must be done, but Netherlands itself imposes no extra requirement on arrival. Pet birds have special requirements (see Additional Info) but for dogs/cats/ferrets, no parasite checks beyond visual health inspection.</li>
      <li><em>Age Minimum:</em> 15 weeks. The Netherlands **allows** entry of unvaccinated pets <12 weeks in specific cases (EU young pet exemption)【34†L34-L42】【34†L44-L52】. This means a puppy/kitten under 3 months can enter if accompanied by a statement of confinement or by its vaccinated mother, and coming from a country with low rabies risk. In practice, the Netherlands permits this exemption under strict conditions.</li>
      <li><em>Banned Breeds/Species:</em> No banned dog breeds for import. The Netherlands removed its breed-specific ban in 2008; currently no breeds are forbidden to bring in. However, the import of dogs with cropped ears or docked tails is **prohibited** for animal welfare reasons (unless the owner can prove it was done for medical necessity)【18†L149-L157】【19†L1-L4】. There are also restrictions on importing certain wild or CITES-listed animals, but common pets are fine.</li>

      <li>Designated entry points: Schiphol Airport (Amsterdam) is a major designated airport for pet entry from outside the EU, with a Border Control Post for live animals. Pets should be presented to Customs/veterinary officials upon arrival for checks.</li>
      <li>Special rules for **pet birds**: max 5 pet birds can enter with owner; they require an owner’s declaration (not for commercial use or sale, and not taken to a show within 30 days)【34†L43-L51】 and a veterinary health certificate. Birds must have an identification (closed leg ring or microchip) and either a 30-day pre-export quarantine, or a negative avian influenza test, or proof of vaccination as per EU rules to avoid quarantine on arrival. The Netherlands enforces these EU-wide bird import rules strictly to prevent avian diseases.</li>
      <li>Cosmetic surgery ban: Dogs with cropped ears or docked tails, as noted, are not allowed to be imported or shown in NL【18†L149-L157】.

      <li>Entry points: If arriving from outside the EU with a pet, one should enter Poland through an airport or border crossing where there is a veterinary border control (e.g., Warsaw Chopin Airport has one). The pet and its documents should be presented to Customs and the Border Veterinarian Service upon arrival.</li>
      <li>Domestic law: Poland has a list of dog breeds considered aggressive; owners of those breeds need a municipal permit to keep them. These breeds include e.g. American Pit Bull Terrier, Canary Mastiff, American Bulldog, etc. This does not prevent import, but owners moving to Poland with such a dog should seek the permit post-arrival. All dogs in Poland must be leashed in public and muzzled if they pose a threat; this applies to visitors as well.</li>

This is a domestic law, not an import requirement, but owners should be aware.</li>

In practice, importing a Pit Bull-type dog (undefined pedigree) is prohibited by law in Romania. Purebred AmStaffs with pedigree are Category II and can be imported with compliance.

      <li><em>Other Vaccinations:</em> Not required by import law. (Only rabies is compulsory. Some autonomous communities in Spain require dogs to be vaccinated for rabies by law once residing, but for entry into Spain, it’s not checked beyond rabies. No requirement for distemper, etc., at border.)</li>

      <li><em>Parasite Treatment:</em> Not required for entry into mainland Spain. (Spain is not Echinococcus-free, so no obligation for tapeworm treatment of dogs arriving. If coming from a country with Echinococcus rules like UK, the dog would have been treated before departure, but Spain doesn’t require proof of it on arrival.) Tick/flea treatments not required but recommended due to Mediterranean parasites (e.g., leishmaniasis risk from sandflies, not ticks, so not directly relevant to border control).</li>

(Note: Spain has “Potentially Dangerous Dogs” regulations: breeds like Pit Bull, Staffordshire Terrier, Rottweiler, Dogo Argentino, Fila Brasileiro, Tosa, Akita are labeled as PPP. They are **not banned** from entry, but owners must comply with licensing, insurance, muzzle/leash rules once in Spain. This is domestic law, not an import restriction.) No special restrictions on cat breeds. Invasive species (e.g. certain turtles) cannot be imported as pets – e.g., red-eared slider turtle is banned to import as it’s invasive.

If arriving by ferry, e.g., from Morocco, the port must have vet controls.</li>
      <li>Regional considerations: Canary Islands, Ceuta, Melilla (see separate entries) have same base requirements but may have additional local health recommendations. Movement of pets from mainland to Canary Islands technically still within Spain/EU so pet passport suffices.</li>
      <li>“Potentially Dangerous” dog breeds (8 breeds incl. Pit Bull, Rottweiler, etc.) require owners to obtain a local license and carry liability insurance if staying in Spain longer-term.

This requirement currently applies to dogs coming from all countries except Finland and UK/Ireland/Malta/Norway (which are free of E. multilocularis). In practice, if you travel to Sweden with a dog from continental Europe (where Echinococcus is present), you must get tapeworm treatment 1–5 days before arrival. Cats and ferrets: no tapeworm requirement. Tick treatment is recommended but not required.</li>
      <li><em>Age Minimum:</em> 15 weeks. Sweden does <strong>not allow</strong> entry of pets younger than 12 weeks without rabies vaccination (no exceptions)【5†L613-L617】. (Sweden historically had zero tolerance for unvaccinated young pets because of its rabies-free status.)</li>
      <li><em>Banned Breeds/Species:</em> No specific dog breed bans for import. Sweden does not ban any breeds (it focuses on dog behavior rather than breed). All breeds may enter if they meet the health requirements. Cropped ears or docked tails: Sweden generally bans docking, but import of already docked/cropped pets is allowed if the procedure was legal in the country of origin. No special restrictions on cat breeds or common pet species. (Wolf hybrids need a permit as they are considered wild animals.)</li>
    </ul>
  </td>
  <td>No quarantine for pets meeting all the entry conditions. Sweden abolished regular quarantine with the pet passport system. A pet with proper documents, microchip, rabies vacc (and tapeworm treatment for dogs) can enter without quarantine. Non-compliant pets (e.g., no rabies vacc) may be denied entry or quarantined at owner’s cost until they meet requirements (which could be lengthy), but this is avoided by strict enforcement at entry.</td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>Up to 5 pets per traveler (more requires meeting conditions for non-commercial exemption or else via commercial import rules)【26†L298-L306】.</li>
      <li>Tapeworm treatment: **mandatory for dogs** 1–5 days before entering Sweden【5†L619-L627】 (unless coming directly from a tapeworm-free country like Finland or from Norway). This is a notable extra requirement (similar to Finland, UK, etc.). Owners must ensure a vet gives the pill and documents it.</li>
      <li>No young pet exemption – Sweden does **not** permit underage unvaccinated pets to enter【5†L613-L617】. Rabies-free policy means every pet must be vaccinated.</li>
      <li>Designated entry points: Pets from non-EU countries (and even from EU by air) should enter via airports or border crossings where Swedish Customs does animal checks. Notably, if flying from outside the EU, one must arrive at Stockholm Arlanda, Gothenburg or Malmö Airport where proper checks can be done. Travelers must report to Customs (the red channel) with pets.【14†L73-L81】</li>
      <li>After entry: Dogs should be registered with the Swedish Board of Agriculture if staying longer than 3 months. There is no national leash law, but local regulations apply. No breed-specific restrictions in Sweden – evaluation is individual behavior based.</li>

    <ul>
      <li><em>Microchip:</em> Required for all dogs, cats, ferrets. Must be implanted before rabies vaccination【7†L131-L139】. ISO-compatible chip or owner provides own reader.</li>
      <li><em>Rabies Vaccination:</em> Mandatory. Pet must be ≥12 weeks old at vaccination. 21-day wait after initial vaccination before entry【7†L133-L141】. Booster shots must be kept current (no wait if continuous coverage). If coming from a country not free of rabies, the primary vacc + wait suffice as UK lists most countries.</li>
      <li><em>Other Vaccinations:</em> Not required by import rules (only rabies). (Leptospirosis, parvo, etc., are recommended but not required for entry.)</li>
      <li><em>Health Certificate:</em> Since Brexit, an EU pet passport issued by an EU country is no longer accepted for GB entry unless issued before 1 Jan 2021 and still valid. Instead:<ul>
            <li>If traveling from the EU or a “Part 1” listed country (e.g., USA, Australia): need an official veterinary certificate (the “GB pet health certificate”) issued in the country of departure, valid 10 days for entry into GB【7†L138-L146】. An EU Pet Passport issued by EU (or Northern Ireland) is also accepted for entry into GB【12†L64-L72】.</li>
            <li>For UK residents returning: an EU pet passport (issued pre-Brexit) or a new “UK Pet Health Certificate” issued by a UK vet (valid for multiple trips) is used.</li>
            <li>The certificate/passport must be in English and show microchip, rabies vacc details, etc.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li><em>Import Permit:</em> Not required for dogs, cats, ferrets from listed countries. **However, an import license is required for other pet species** (e.g., rabbits, rodents, birds) coming from outside the EU【43†L102-L110】【43†L153-L162】. Also, dogs from certain high-rabies countries require a special permit as of 2021 (UK currently prohibits direct import from high-risk countries without quarantine).</li>
      <li><em>Rabies Titer:</em> Not generally required from EU/listed countries (UK treats EU, US, etc. as low-risk). If coming from an “unlisted” high-risk country, UK requires a rabies titer test taken >30 days after vacc and then a 3-month wait after the blood sample date before entry【1†L91-L99】 (similar to EU). Dogs from high-risk countries also need a CDC import permit if coming via air through the US, etc., but UK has its own rules: currently, direct import from high-risk is not allowed unless going through quarantine or third country.</li>
      <li><em>Parasite Treatment:</em> **Tapeworm treatment (Echinococcus) is required for dogs entering Great Britain** (England, Scotland, Wales) except if coming directly from tapeworm-free countries (Finland, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Malta)【12†L69-L72】. The dog must be treated by a vet 24–120 hours (1–5 days) before entry with a praziquantel-based wormer and have it recorded by the vet【7†L139-L146】【12†L69-L72】. Cats and ferrets: no tapeworm requirement. Tick treatment is no longer required (was mandatory pre-2012, but now optional).</li>
      <li><em>Age Restrictions:</em> Minimum age ~15 weeks. Practically, the UK does not allow unvaccinated pets. Puppies/kittens must be old enough to vaccinate (12 weeks) plus 21 days, so ~15 weeks minimum to enter【7†L133-L141】. Young animal exemptions are not allowed for GB.</li>
      <li><em>Banned Breeds:</em> The UK bans the import (and ownership) of four dog types: **Pit Bull Terrier, Japanese Tosa, Dogo Argentino, and Fila Brasileiro**【69†L135-L140】. Any dog that “matches the characteristics” of these types may be seized, even if it has a different breed name【69†L133-L141】. (This is per the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991.) Additionally, as of Feb 2024, the American XL Bully is being added to the banned list in England and Wales【69†L137-L143】. These banned dogs cannot be brought into Great Britain unless a court has issued an exemption certificate *prior* (which is rare). No banned cat breeds. Certain exotic animals (primates, etc.) are also banned as pets.</li>
    </ul>
  </td>
  <td>No quarantine for pets from approved countries that meet all requirements. The UK’s long-standing quarantine system has been replaced by PETS scheme rules. **However, if requirements are not met, animals may be quarantined up to 4 months** or refused entry【7†L149-L157】. For example, a dog with no tapeworm treatment may be held until treated and 24 hours passed. Pets from unlisted high-rabies countries without proper prep are still subject to quarantine (or refused). Great Britain currently has no routine quarantine for compliant EU or listed-country pets.</td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>Up to 5 pets allowed per person (more than 5 requires use of commercial rules or proof of attending a competition)【7†L155-L162】.</li>
      <li>Dogs must have tapeworm treatment 1–5 days before arrival (exceptions: coming directly from Finland, Ireland, NI, Malta)【12†L75-L80】. Owners should ensure the vet’s treatment date/time is recorded accurately, as UK Border Force will check it.</li>
      <li>Approved entry routes: Pets must travel via approved carriers and routes. For example, pets entering by air must arrive as manifest cargo (except assistance dogs) at approved airports (Heathrow, Gatwick, etc.), and by sea only on certain ferries or Eurotunnel from France【7†L125-L133】. Advance notice to the Border Inspection Post is often required. Northern Ireland has separate EU-aligned rules.</li>
      <li>Owners must fill out a declaration confirming the pet isn’t being sold or transferred (non-commercial use)【7†L143-L146】. This form should accompany the health certificate.</li>
      <li>Snub-nosed breeds: Not banned, but some airlines may not transport them. UK specifically doesn’t ban any on breed except the dangerous dog types. Also note UK has strict welfare checks; if a pet appears ill on arrival (e.g., signs of screwworm), vet examination and treatment/quarantine may occur.【63†L31-L35】</li>

      <li><em>Microchip & Vaccinations:</em> Required. Rabies vaccination is mandatory (Greenland is rabies-free in some zones, but vaccinating is required due to risk from wildlife). Proof of distemper and parvovirus vaccines for dogs and feline panleukopenia for cats are also required per Danish rep rules【50†L103-L112】.</li>
      <li><em>Import Permit:</em> **Required** from Greenland’s Veterinary Services (via Danish Representation in Copenhagen). Only allowed to certain parts of Greenland (southwestern coast)【50†L91-L99】.</li>
      <li><em>Other Requirements:</em> Health certificate issued 14 days before travel, municipality permission, and if a female dog, certificate of spay (female dogs must be sterilized before import)【50†L107-L115】.</li>
      <li><em>Quarantine:</em> No formal quarantine on arrival, but imported pets are subject to monitoring and must essentially remain in permitted area. Working dogs (e.g. north of Arctic Circle sled dogs) cannot be mixed with imported breeds.</li>
      <li><em>Banned Breeds:</em> Dogs can only be imported to the southern part of West Greenland. Import of dogs to the sled-dog regions (north of 66°N) is not permitted to protect the native Greenland Dog purity【50†L91-L100】.</li>

  <td><strong>Svalbard</strong> (Norway territory)</td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Microchip & Vaccinations:</em> Required. Svalbard is rabies-free but surrounded by rabies-present regions (Arctic foxes). Dogs can only enter with a **permit** and must be rabies vaccinated and have a rabies titer test done before entry【61†L9-L16】.</li>
      <li><em>Import Permit:</em> **Required** from the Norwegian Food Safety Authority for any dog (cats/rabbits generally not allowed at all). It is illegal to import live mammals or birds to Svalbard without permission【61†L1-L9】.</li>
      <li><em>Parasite Treatment:</em> Dogs must be treated for tapeworm (Echinococcus) 24–120h before arrival (since Svalbard is Echinococcus-free) and also must have broad-spectrum dewormer and external parasite treatment shortly before travel【61†L17-L24】.</li>
      <li><em>Quarantine:</em> Not a formal facility, but dogs may be subject to checks and possibly kept isolated upon arrival until a vet clears them.</li>
      <li><em>Banned:</em> Import of cats is generally not allowed. Only dogs (with permit) and certain caged pets like rabbits (with permit) might be allowed. Birds are not allowed to protect local fauna.</li>

      <li><em>Microchip & Rabies:</em> Required (similar to UK/EU). Gibraltar, while UK territory, followed EU pet rules. Post-Brexit, it aligns with UK: microchip, rabies vacc (21-day wait) needed.</li>
      <li><em>Documentation:</em> EU Pet Passports issued in Gibraltar (while in EU) are no longer valid for EU travel; for entry to Gibraltar, a UK (GB) pet health certificate or a Gibraltar-issued certificate is needed. Essentially, pets entering from Spain/EU should meet EU requirements; pets entering from UK follow UK rules.</li>
      <li><em>Tapeworm:</em> Required for dogs 24–120h before arrival (same as UK) because Gibraltar is currently following UK’s regime.</li>

      <li><em>Documentation:</em> EU Pet Passport or EU health certificate (if arriving from outside EU). If coming from mainland France, the EU pet passport is used but no “import” control since it’s same country (though airlines may check). If coming from say the USA to Martinique, needs the same steps as to France (microchip, rabies, titer if applicable, EU health cert in French).</li>
