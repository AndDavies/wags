        At Wags and Wanders, we believe that no adventure should leave your pet behind. Founded by Andrew &#38; Ashley,
        our journey began with a street dog named Baggo and evolved into a mission to transform the way pet parents
        travel with their furry companions.

          <p className="mb-4 text-offblack">
            Our first experience with pet travel wasn&#39;t planned&#8212;it started when we met Baggo, an abandoned dog
            in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Navigating the complex regulations, airline policies, and health requirements to
            bring him home to Canada opened our eyes to the gaps in pet travel resources.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-offblack">
            Later, as we embraced a nomadic lifestyle, studying and working abroad, we encountered firsthand the
            frustrations, misinformation, and last-minute hurdles that come with international pet travel.
          </p>
          <p className="text-offblack">
            We met pet owners turned away at airport check-ins, stuck in bureaucratic nightmares, and forced into costly
            delays&#8212;all due to fragmented, outdated, or hard-to-find information. This inspired us to build Wags
            and Wanders, an AI-powered solution designed to make pet travel seamless, stress-free, and fully informed.
